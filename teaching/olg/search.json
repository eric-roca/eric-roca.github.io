    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model, one of the most versatile and influential frameworks in modern macroeconomics. Unlike the Ramsey model with infinitely-lived agents, the OLG framework captures the realistic life-cycle dynamics where individuals live for finite periods, making decisions about consumption, savings, and intergenerational transfers.\nThe OLG model is particularly powerful for analyzing issues that involve intergenerational considerations, such as social security systems, public debt sustainability, educational policies, and long-run economic development. The course combines theoretical foundations with applications to contemporary economic research, demonstrating how this framework helps us understand fundamental questions about economic growth, inequality, and policy design.\nThrough the study of cutting-edge research papers, we explore how economists use the OLG framework to investigate diverse phenomena from the evolution of social preferences to environmental sustainability.",

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nBased on Croix and Michel (2009).\nWe have studied the Ramsey model, which predicts that the path derived from the competitive equilibrium is optimal. One of the main features of this model is that agents have an infinite horizon: they live forever and optimise considering an infinite horizon.\nThe overlapping generations model changes this hypothesis and focuses on the life-cycle: agents make decisions regarding how to consume, and how much to save for retirement. This is, the OLG model assumes that agents work until some age, and then retire.1 A focus of the OLG model is the intergenerational redistribution, allowing to study:\nThe main departure with respect to the Ramsey model is that in OLG, agents are heterogeneous. Individuals live for two periods of time, and then die. In the first period, they are young and work. When old, they retire and live from savings. Hence, at any point in time, two types of agents with different budget constraints exist: young and adults.2\nAs we shall see, in this model the competitive path may not be optimal. Consequently, there may be instances in which the utility of all individuals can be increased. Therefore, the OLG model opens the door to government intervention, to reallocate consumption and savings efficiently. The OLG framework also permits the existence of bubbles and fluctuations.\nA basic reference for this model is Diamond (1965) Numerical exercises Sample exam",

We shall have initial conditions detailing the state of the economy at \\(t=0.\\)\n\n2.2.1 Individuals live for two periods\nThe main difference with respect to the Ramsey model is that in the OLG model, individuals live for two periods. Note: this means that, at every point in time, two generations are alive and overlap.\nThis is relevant: the economy goes on forever but individuals only operate during some periods. Hence, there will be infinite two-period-lived generations. In particular, at \\(t=0\\), we will have a young and an adult generation. This adult generation will die at the end of \\(t=1\\), the young generation will become adults and have children: the new young generation of \\(t=2.\\) Hence, we can represent the generations diagrammatically —in brackets I have denoted the year in which each generation was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=0\\)\n\\(t=1\\)\n\\(t=2\\)\n\\(t=3\\)\n\\(t=4\\)\n\\(t=5\\)\n\n\n\n\nOld (t=-1)\nDie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=0)\nOld (t=0)\nDie\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=1)\nOld (t=1)\nDie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=2)\nOld (t=2)\nDie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=3)\nOld (t=3)\nDie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=4)\nOld (t=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung(t=5)\n\n\n\n\nTo simplify the model, we assume that each adult born in \\(t-1\\) has \\(n&gt;-1\\) children.

    "text": "2.3 Assumptions\n\n2.3.1 Firms\nWe assume that a large number of identical firms populate the economy. Firms produce a single, homogeneous good using labour and capital. The production function \\(F(K,L)\\) has the following properties:\nAssumption OLG 1: The production function satisfies the following properties:\n\nOLG 1.1 \\(F(K, L)\\) is continuous and defined on \\([0,+\\infty)^{2},\\)\nOLG 1.2 \\(F(K, L)\\) has continuous derivatives of every required order on \\((0,+\\infty)^2,\\)\nOLG 1.3 The production function is strictly increasing in both arguments: \\(F_{i}(K, L) &gt; 0\\),\nOLG 1.4 The production function is strictly concave: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  F_{ii}(K, L) & &lt; 0 \\\\\n  F_{ii}(K,L)  & F_{jj}(K, L) - F_{ij}(K, L)F_{ji}(K, L)&gt;0\n  \\end{align*}\\]\nOLG 1.5 \\(F(K, L)\\) is homogeneous of degree one.\nOLG 1.6 \\(F(K, L)\\) satisfies the Inada conditions:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{K \\rightarrow 0} F^\\prime_{K}(K, L) &= \\lim_{L \\rightarrow 0} F^\\prime_{L}(K, L) = +\\infty \\\\\n\\lim_{K \\rightarrow +\\infty} F^\\prime_{K}(K, L) &= \\lim_{L \\rightarrow +\\infty} F^\\prime_{L}(K, L) = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote: Assumption OLG 1.4 implies that the Hessian matrix of the production function is negative definite, hence the function is strictly concave.\nFirms maximise real profits. Since there are many firms competing, in equilibrium they make exactly zero profits. Moreover, in equilibrium factors are paid their marginal productivity. Since the production function \\(F\\) is homogeneous of degree, we can write it in intensive terms:\n\\[\nf(k) \\equiv F\\left(\\frac{K}{L},1\\right), \\quad k \\equiv \\frac{K}{L}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nBecause markets are competitive, capital earns its marginal product \\(\\partial F(K,L)/ \\partial K\\) or, equivalently, \\(f^{\\prime}(k)\\) in intensive terms. Thus, the real interest rate at time \\(t\\) is:\n\\[\nr_{t} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t}).\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nThe marginal product of labour is given by \\(\\partial F(K,L)/\\partial L.\\) In intensive terms, it is equal to:\n\\[\nw_{t} = f(k) - f^{\\prime}(k) k.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\n\n\n2.3.2 Households\nIndividuals live for two periods. As before, we assume perfect foresight for individuals. Assumption OLG 2 Individuals have perfect foresight.\nWhen young, they are endowed with one unit of labour that they supply inestastically. Assumption OLG 3 Individuals supply one unit of labour inelastically when young. They receive the ongoing wage rate \\(w_{t}\\) and allocate this income between:\n\ncurrent consumption \\(c_{t}\\),\nsavings \\(s_{t}\\) that are invested in the firms.\n\nTherefore, the budget constraint of a young individual in period \\(t\\) is:\n\\[\nw_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t}.\n\\]\nOnce an individual reaches old age the next period, he consumes his savings (plus the interest rate received), reproduces —exogenous fertility at rate \\(n\\)— and dies. Old people do not care about anything happening after death. Therefore, an agent has one unique choice:\n\nconsumption when adult, \\(d_{t+1}.\\)\n\nThe budget constraint for this period is:\n\\[\ns_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = d_{t+1}.\n\\]\nwith \\(\\delta \\in (0,1)\\) being the capital depreciation rate.\nHence, an individual faces two budget constraints. However, we can collapse both into a unique intertemporal budget constraint.\n\n2.3.2.1 The intertemporal budget constraint\nIn the economy, we have consumption as the numeraire. It is more convenient for us to combine the two budget constraints corresponding to young and old ages into one single constraint. Starting from\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nw_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\nd_{t+1} = s_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = s_{t} R_{t+1}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nwhere \\(R_{t} \\equiv 1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}\\) represents the return on savings, isolate \\(s_{t}\\) in the second equation and plug it in the first one:\n\\[\nw_{t} = c_{t} + \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}.\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nThe intertemporal budget constraint indicates that the total present value of income (\\(w_{t}\\), the only source of income) equals the total present value of expenditures. The present value of consumption when old \\(d_{t+1}\\) is discounted using the interest rate \\(R_{t+1}.\\)\nIt is clear that savings, as usual, will be a function of wages \\(w\\) and interests \\(R.\\) So will consumption at all periods of time.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Utility function\nWe suppose that the life-cycle utility function is additively separable:\n\\[\nU(c,d) = u( c ) + \\beta u(d),\\, \\beta \\in(0,1)\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta \\in (0,1)\\) is the psychological discount factor. We assume that \\(u( c )\\) has the properties\nAssumption OLG 4\n\nOLG 4.1 \\(u^{\\prime}( c ) &gt; 0,\\)\nOLG 4.2 \\(u^{\\prime \\prime} ( c ) &lt; 0,\\)\nOLG 4.3 \\(\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c) = +\\infty.\\)\n\nThe last assumption \\(\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c ) = +\\infty\\) implies that an individual will always have a positive consumption —as long as he has enough income to finance it.\nAnother important implication of the choice of the utility formulation is that \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are normal goods: the demand is not decreasing in wealth. It follows from additive separability and concavity. \n\n\n\n2.3.3 The behaviour of individuals\nAt time \\(t\\), young individuals receive their wages, consume and save while maximising the utility function.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) \\\\\n& \\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\n& \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad d_{t+1} = R_{t+1}s_{t} \\\\\n& \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad c_{t} \\geq 0, d_{t+1} \\geq 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nWe have two possibilities to solve this problem:\n\n2.3.3.1 Substitution\nFirst, we can substitute \\(c_{t}\\) and \\(d_{t+1}\\) in the utility function, leading to:\n\\[\nu(w_{t} - s_{t}) + \\beta u(R_{t+1}s_{t}).\n\\]\nThis function is strictly concave with respect to \\(s_{t}\\) because of our assumptions. The solution is the savings function:\n\\[\ns_{t} = s(w_{t}, R_{t+1}).\n\\]\nThe solution is interior as a consequence of the assumptions, and it is characterised by the first-order condition:\n\\[\nu^{\\prime}(w_{t} - s_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(R_{t+1}s_{t}).\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\n\n\n2.3.3.2 Lagrangian\nInstead, we can use the intertemporal budget constraint and build the Lagrangian:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) + \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} - c_{t} - \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}).\n\\]\nThe first order conditions imply that:\n\\[\nu^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\lambda_{t}, \\quad \\beta u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{t}}{R_{t+1}}.\n\\]\nCombining both, we obtain Equation 2.8 again: \\[\nu^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime (d_{t+1}).\n\\]",

Risk averse individuals do not want large changes in consumption, so they have a large risk aversion and are not willing to trade off future and present consumption. Conversely, risk neutral individuals do not mind abrupt changes in consumption, so they are willing to trade off future and present consumption.\nHence, in this model, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution coincides with the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Note: If you read Croix and Michel (2009, 12) , they take a different approach and also refuse to use the concept or risk aversion: the model does not feature risk.\n\n2.4.1 CIES example\nWe illustrate the previous concept using a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution utility function:\n\\[\nu( c ) = \\frac{c^{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}}{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}.\n\\]\nIn this case, we have the following Euler condition:\n\\[\nu^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) \\implies \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} = \\left( \\beta R_{t+1} \\right)^\\sigma.\n\\]\nTherefore, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial  \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} }{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{R_{t+1}}{\\color{red}{\\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}}}}= \\sigma (\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma-1}\\beta R_{t+1} \\color{red}{\\frac{1}{(\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma}}} = \\sigma.\n\\]\nMeanwhile, the coefficient of relative risk aversion\n\\[\nRRA( c ) = - \\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}( c )}{u^{\\prime}( c )}c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\epsilon^{-1}_{d_{t+1},c_{t}}\n\\]\nis the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.",

We consume more of all goods —\\(c_{t}\\) and \\(d_{t+1}\\) are normal goods.\nSubstitution effect: it is more profitable to save and consume \\(d_{t+1},\\) inducing savings.\n\nWhen the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is lower than 1, the substitution effect is dominated by the income effect. In that case, a rise in the rate of return has a negative effect on savings. When the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is higher than 1, households are ready to exploit the rise in the remuneration of savings by consuming relatively less today. In this case, raising the rate of return boosts savings. When the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is equal to 1 (log-utility), the income effect exactly compensates the substitution effect and there is no effect of the rate of return on savings.\n\n2.5.2.1 Example using a CIES function\nUnder a CIES utility, we have that:\n\\[\ns(w,R) = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}}w,\n\\]\nand \\[\ns^{\\prime}_w  =\\frac{1}{1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}} &gt; 0.\n\\]\nHowever, \\(s^{\\prime}_{R} = - \\frac{w \\beta^{-\\sigma} R^{-\\sigma}}{\\left(1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}\\right)^{2}}(1-\\sigma)\\gtreqqless 0\\) depending on \\(\\sigma \\lesseqqgtr 1.\\)\nLog-utility:\nIn the case of logarithmic utility, savings are independent of the interest rate \\(R\\) and are linear in wages. Log-utility is a special case of the CIES function when \\(\\sigma=1.\\) In this case, the wealth and substitution effects cancel each other:\n\\[\ns(w,R) = \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w.\n\\]\n\n\n2.5.2.2 Example using a CES function\nNote: This is a transformation of the CIES function, so things will look rather similar.\n\\[\nU(c,d) = \\left[ \\alpha c^{\\frac{\\epsilon-1}{\\epsilon}} + (1-\\alpha)d^{\\frac{\\epsilon-1}{\\epsilon}} \\right]^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon-1}}.\n\\]\nFrom here, substituting \\(c=w-s\\) and \\(d=Rs\\), and solving for the optimal savings we obtain:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\alpha (w-s)^{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}} = (1-\\alpha) R (Rs)^{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}} \\\\\n& s = \\frac{\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{-\\epsilon} w}{R^{1-\\epsilon} + \\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{-\\epsilon}} = \\frac{w}{1+\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{\\epsilon} R^{1-\\epsilon}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\ns^{\\prime}_{R} = - \\frac{w}{\\left(1+\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{\\epsilon} R^{1-\\epsilon}\\right)^{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right)^{\\epsilon}(1-\\epsilon)R^{-\\epsilon}.\n\\]\nThen, when \\(\\epsilon &gt;1\\) savings increase with the interest rate: \\(s^{\\prime}_{R} &gt; 0.\\) In that case, the substitution effect dominates. Alternative interpretation: \\(\\epsilon\\) is the elasticity of intertemporal substitutability, hence if it is large, individuals are willing to substitute present consumption for future consumption. Alternative interpretation: \\(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\) measures the relative risk aversion. Hence, for large \\(\\epsilon\\) individuals accept more risk, meaning that they are willing to accept more changes in consumption. Smoothing is less important.\nConversely, when \\(\\epsilon &lt;1\\), an increase in the interest rate lowers savings: \\(s^{\\prime}_{R} &lt; 0.\\) In that case, the wealth effect dominates. \\(\\epsilon &lt; 1\\) also means that \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are intertemporally complementary, and individuals want to consume them in constant proportions.",

    "text": "2.6 Temporary equilibrium\nBefore turning to the intertemporal equilibrium and the analysis of the steady state, we study the temporary equilibrium that takes place every period.\nWe have not discussed the firms, but they follow the same setup as in Ramsey: use capital and labour in a perfectly competitive environment.\nWe shall work in intensive form: \\(k_{t} \\equiv \\frac{K_{t}}{N_{t}}.\\)\n\nLabour market equilibrium: Only young individuals supply labour. Moreover, they do so inelastically. During period \\(t\\) there are \\(N_{t}\\) young agents and, hence, the supply of labour is \\(N_{t}\\). Equating this to labour demand from firms \\(L_{t}\\) gives the wage rate: \\[\nw_{t} = \\omega\\left(\\frac{K_{t}}{N_{t}}\\right)=\\omega(k_{t}).\n\\]\nCapital market: Only old individuals own capital. Since firms operate competitively, they make zero profits. Hence, \\(f^{\\prime}(k_{t})K_{t}\\) is distributed as interests. Old households receive \\(N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t}.\\) So, what old households receive must equal what firms distribute In other terms: \\(R_{t}K_{t}= f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) K_{t}\\) and \\(R_t = f^\\prime (k_t).\\)\nGood market: Finding the equilibrium for this market departs from the otherwise similar Ramsey case. Remember that we have two types of agents: young and old. Total production is given by:\n\\[\nY_{t} = F(K_{t}, N_{t}) = \\color{red}{N_{t}} f(k_{t}).\n\\]\nTotal demand for goods combines the consumption of \\(d_{t}\\), the old generation living in period \\(t\\), and the demand for consumption and investment from the young: \\(c_{t}, s_{t}.\\) Therefore, counting how many old and young individuals live during period \\(t\\) we have that total demand equals:\n\\[\nN_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).\n\\]\nThe equilibrium on the goods market implies: \\[\nY_{t} = N_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).\n\\]\nAlso, we can check that total production equals total consumption: \\[\nN_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) = N_{t}w_{t}=N_{t}(f(k_{t})-k_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t})) = Y_{t}-K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}),\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{t-1}d_{t} = N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t} = K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}).\n\\]\n\n\nA temporary equilibrium is a set \\(\\\\{w_{t}, R_{t}, K_{t}, L_{t}, Y_{t}, k_{t}, I_{t}, c_{t}, s_{t}, d_{t}\\\\}\\) that satisfies:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n     w_{t} = \\omega(k_{t}), \\\\\n     R_{t} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t}), \\\\\n     L_{t} = N_{t}, \\\\\n     Y_{t} = N_{t}f(k_{t}), \\\\\n     Y_{t} = N_{t-1}d_t + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) \\\\\n     I_{t} = N_{t}s_{t}, \\\\\n     c_{t} = w_{t} - s_{t}, \\\\\n     s_{t} = s(\\omega(k_{t}),R_{t+1}), \\\\\n     d_{t} = R_{t}s_{t-1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe existence of a temporary equilibrium is guaranteed because the functions are single-valued.",

The proof is quite involved, though, as is presented below. Having an intertemporal equilibrium means having a solution for \\(k_{t+1}\\) in the equation\n\\[\nk_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime (k_{t+1})),\n\\]\nwhere \\(k_t\\) is predetermined at \\(t.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nThe proof uses the following equation about savings: \\[\n0&lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) &lt; w.\n\\]\nIn words, it indicates that individuals have positive savings, and they save only part of their total income.\nNext, define \\[\nH(k,w) = (1+n)k - s(w, f^\\prime(k))= 0.\n\\]\nBasically, here we are using the definition of an intertemporal equilibrium. Having an intertemporal equilibrium is then equivalent to finding a \\(k\\) satisfying the previous equation.\nWe use the intermediate value theorem to show that at least one solution exists. First, we analyse the behaviour of \\(H(k,w)\\) when \\(k\\) tends to \\(+\\infty.\\)\nFrom \\(0&lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) &lt; w,\\) we have\n\\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} &lt; \\frac{w}{k}.\n\\]\nLimit when \\(k \\rightarrow +\\infty\\)\nKeeping \\(w\\) fixed, the limit of \\(\\frac{w}{k}\\) when \\(k \\rightarrow +\\infty\\) is 0. Then,\n\\[\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = 0.\n\\]\nConsequently,\n\\[\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{H(w,k)}{k} = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} (1+n) - \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = 1+n &gt; 0.\n\\]\nLimit when \\(k \\rightarrow 0\\)\nWhen \\(k\\) tends to zero, we shall distinguish two cases regarding \\(f^\\prime (k)\\). It can be that either\n\nCase \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) = f^\\prime (0)&gt; 0\\) and finite. Then, the function \\(s(w, f^\\prime(k))\\) is well defined and positive and we have:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} H(w,k) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\left[(1+n)k - s(w,f^\\prime (k)) \\right] = -s(w, f^\\prime (k)) &lt; 0.\n\\]\n\nCase \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) = +\\infty.\\) Two things can occur in that case.\n\nSavings are positive: \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} s(w,f^\\prime (k))&gt;0.\\) This case is analogous to the previous one:\n\\[\n  \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} H(w,k) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\left[(1+n)k - s(w,f^\\prime (k)) \\right] = -s(w, f^\\prime (k)) &lt; 0.\n  \\]\nSavings tend to zero: \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} s(w, f^\\prime (k)) = 0.\\) In this case, since the interest rate goes to infinity individuals tend to save zero. This implies that consumption in the second period, \\(d\\), tends to infinity. To see this, first notice that \\(d = f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k)).\\) Moreover, from the first order conditions we know that: \\[\n  u^\\prime (d) = \\frac {u^\\prime ( w - s)}{\\beta f^\\prime (k)}\n  \\]\nand hence \\[\n  \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}u^\\prime (d) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}\\frac {u^\\prime ( w - s)}{\\beta f^\\prime (k)}=0.\n  \\]\nHence, \\(u^\\prime (d)\\) tends to zero which means that \\(d\\) goes to infinity. Therefore:\n\\[\n  \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k)) = +\\infty.\n  \\]\nWe also know that \\(0 &lt; f^\\prime (k) k &lt; f(k)\\) because \\(f^\\prime (k) k + \\omega(k) = f(k)\\) and \\(\\omega(k) &gt; 0.\\) Therefore, for a bounded \\(0&lt;k&lt;1\\) we also have \\(f^\\prime (k) k &lt; f(1).\\) Hence, for \\(k&lt;1\\):\n\\[\n  \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = \\frac{f^\\prime(k) s(w,f^\\prime(k))}{f^\\prime (k) k} &gt; \\frac{f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{f(1)}.\n  \\]\nThen,\n\\[\n  \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{s(w,f^\\prime(k)}{k} = +\\infty\n  \\]\nand \\[\n  \\frac{H(w,k)}{k} = 1+n-\\frac{s(w,f^\\prime(k)}{k} &lt; 0\n  \\]\nfor small \\(k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Uniqueness of the intertemporal equilibrium\nHaving established that at least one level \\(k_{t+1}\\) exists that solves the equation, we would like it to be unique, thus having a unique equilibrium. Otherwise, for some level \\(k\\) there would be multiple values for \\(k_{t+1}\\) (meaning multiple values for the savings). Individuals lack a coordinating mechanism to select any of these equilibria.\nWe show that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution \\(\\sigma\\) is important in determining uniqueness. In particular, if \\(\\sigma &gt; 1\\), then the equilibrium is unique. We will revisit this issue later.\nWe have used the intermediate value theorem to show that solutions exist. Moreover, it shows that \\(\\lim_{k\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{H(w,k)}{k} &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\frac{H(w,k)}{k} &gt; 0.\\) Therefore, if \\(H(w,k)\\) is monotonically increasing in \\(k\\), then there is one and only one solution to \\(H(w,k)=0.\\) Hence, we would have a unique solution. This means that given a value \\(k_{t},\\) we can find a unique valu \\(k_{t+1}.\\)\nIf we take the derivative of \\(H(w,k)\\) with respect to \\(k\\), we obtain:\n\\[\n1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k).\n\\]\nConsequently, in order to have a monotonous function it is sufficient to impose:\nAssumption OLG.4 : \\[\n1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k) &gt; 0.\n\\]\nAnd then, \\(k_{t+1} = g(k_{t}).\\)\nIn particular, this condition indicates that the effect of the interest rate on savings should not be too negative.\nMoreover, if OLG.4 is verified, then \\(k_{t+1}\\) is increasing in \\(k_{t}.\\) Indeed,\n\\[\nk_{t+1} = g(k_t, k_{t+1}) = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t), R(k_{t+1})).\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial g(k_{t}, k_{t+1})}{\\partial k_t}}{\\frac{\\partial g(k_t, k_{t+1})}{\\partial k_{t+1}}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{s^\\prime_{\\omega} \\omega^\\prime(k_t)}^{&gt;0}}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R} \\underbrace{R^\\prime(k_{t+1})}_{=f^{\\prime \\prime} (k_{t+1}) &lt; 0}} &gt; 0,\n\\]\nand \\(k_{t+1}\\) increases in \\(k_{t}.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHence, if the function \\(H\\) is monotonously increasing, the solution is unique. This condition depends on the sign of:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial H(k_{t+1})}{\\partial k_{t+1}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1+n}s^{\\prime}_{R}f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_{t+1}).\n\\]\n\n\nFinally, we can use a more restrictive —but easier to work with— assumption that ensures a unique solution for the intertemporal equilibrium. Assumption OLG.4 states:\n\\[\n1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k) &gt; 0.\n\\]\nTherefore, it is sufficient to have\n\\[\ns^{\\prime}_R \\geq 0\n\\]\nmeaning that savings increase with the interest rate. This behaviour is readily verified when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is at least one. Then, to have monotonic dynamics and unique temporal equilibrium it is sufficient to have \\(\\sigma \\geq 1.\\)\nWe have different cases:\n\n\\(s^\\prime_{R} = 0\\), which happens under log-utility. In this case, \\(s^\\prime_{R} = 0 &gt; \\frac{1+n}{R^\\prime(k_{t+1})}\\) and \\(H(k_{t+1})\\) is always increasing.\n\\(s^\\prime_{R} &gt;0\\), the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is greater than 1 and individuals are willing to trade off higher future consumption against present consumption. Savings increase to consume more in the future. Then, clearly \\(s^\\prime_{R} &gt; 0 &gt; \\frac{1+n}{R^\\prime(k_{t+1})}.\\)\n\\(s^\\prime_{R} &lt; 0\\), we can have a non-monotonous capital path as \\(k_{t+1}\\) can be increasing or decreasing with \\(k_{t}\\).\n\n\n\n2.7.3 Multiple Equilibria and Non-monotonous Dynamics\nUnder case 3, the condition for uniqueness is not satisfied, multiple levels of \\(k_{t+1}\\) solve the intertemporal equilibrium. This section is based on the Groth (2016, 92–93)\nIn that case, the function \\(g(k)\\) is backwards bending for some values of \\(k.\\) This feature implies that there is more than one intemporal equilibrium. We ruled out such a possibility assuming that \\(\\sigma( c ) \\geq 1\\), this is, we imposed a large enough intertemporal elasticity of substitution.\nFor instance, take an isoelastic utility function \\(u( c ) = \\frac{c^{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}-1}{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\) and a CES production with \\(A=20, \\, \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}, \\, \\beta = 0.3, \\, n = 1.097, \\, \\sigma = 0.1, \\, \\rho = -2.\\) First, since \\(\\sigma &lt; 1\\), it allows for the possibility of having multiple temporary equilibria. Second, we can verify that this is the case. For example, if \\(k_{t} = 1\\), then:\n\\(k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_{t}), R(k_{t+1})) \\implies k_{t+1} = \\begin{cases} 0.26 \\\\ 1.234 \\\\ 5.832 \\end{cases}.\\)\nIn fact, for the entire range \\(k_{t} \\in [0.76, 1.37]\\) there is multiplicity of equilibria. Consequently, in all these cases we also have that \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k_{t+1}}{\\mathrm{d}k_t} &lt; 0.\\)\n\n\n\nMultiple equilibria\n\n\nThis implies that, when young individuals observe the current capital level \\(k_t\\), they may expect different future capital levels \\(k_{t+1}\\) depending on their beliefs about the economy: some individuals will expect \\(k_{t+1} = 0.26\\), others \\(k_{t+1} = 1.234\\), and still others \\(k_{t+1} = 5.832\\). Consequently, the capital that will be realized will, in most cases, not coincide with any of these expectations. This violates the perfect foresight assumption, as individuals are not able to accurately predict future capital levels based on current information.",

Then, it must be that for large enough \\(k,\\, g(k) = k_{t+1} &lt; k_{t}\\) and the dynamics are decreasing and converge to some \\(\\bar{k}.\\) In this case, \\(\\bar{k}\\) is the largest steady state, and because the dynamics are monotonic, the economy never goes to the other side of the steady state.\nWe show next that \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.\\) We do so by showing that \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = 0.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nWe start by noting that:\n\\[\n\\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} - \\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)} \\leftarrow \\omega(k) = f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k.\n\\]\nWhen \\(k \\rightarrow +\\infty\\), the first term \\(\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}\\) admits a positive limit, let’s call it \\(\\mathcal{l}_{1}.\\) This is because:\n\n\\(\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} &gt; 0.\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}\\) is decreasing: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{f^\\prime(k)k-f(k)}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k^{2}} &lt; 0.\n\\]\n\nThe second term \\(\\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)}\\) is decreasing and positive, thus it admits a limit \\(\\mathcal{l}_{2}\\) when \\(k \\rightarrow +\\infty.\\)\nApply the mean value theorem evaluated at \\(k\\) and \\(2k\\):\n\\[\nf(2k) - f(k) = (2k-k)f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta)), \\quad \\mathrm{with}\\, \\theta \\in (0,1).\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\n\\frac{2f(2k)}{2k} - \\frac{f(k)}{k} = f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta))\n\\]\nTaking the limit when \\(k \\rightarrow +\\infty\\) we obtain \\(2\\mathcal{l}_{1}-\\mathcal{l}_{1} = \\mathcal{l}_{2} \\implies \\mathcal{l}_{1} = \\mathcal{l}_{2}.\\)\nFinally,\n\\[\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow + \\infty}\\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} =\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} - \\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)}=  \\mathcal{l}_{1} - \\mathcal{l}_{2} = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}}=0\\) and \\(\\frac{g(k)}{k} &lt; \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}}\\) then \\(\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.\\) In conclusion, if the inital value of capital is large enough, the dynamics are decreasing and \\(k\\) converges to an interior steady state \\(\\bar{k}.\\)",

Indeed, because we have \\(f(0) = 0\\), then \\(\\bar{k} = 0\\) is a steady state. The economy has a second steady state, but solving for it explicitly is challenging becuase it involves a third degree polynomial. Nevertheless, let’s sketch the process, knowing that a steady state solves \\(k_t = k_{t+1} = \\bar{k}.\\) To simplify the notation, in what follows I will write \\(k\\) instead of \\(\\bar{k}.\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    k = \\frac{-(1+n) + \\sqrt{(1+n)^2+8(1+n)\\beta^{-3}k^\\frac{1}{2}}}{8(1+n)\\beta^{-3}} &\\implies \\\\\n    1 + 8(1+n)\\beta^{-3}k = \\sqrt{1+8^{-3}k^\\frac{1}{2}} &\\implies \\\\\n    16 \\beta^{-3}k + 64 \\beta^{-6} k^2 = 8 \\beta^{-3} k^\\frac{1}{2} &\\implies \\\\\n    k^\\frac{1}{2}\\left(8 \\beta^{-3}k^\\frac{3}{2} + k^\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) &=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom here, it is obvious that \\(k = 0\\) is a steady state, as we already knew. In principle, the part in brackes may have up to three solutions, but as said, these are hard to get. Instead, we can show that one and only one (real) solution can exist by studying the stability of the steady states. Moreover, the functional form we have is similar to a square root: we have the square root of something to the power \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so this means that the function will behave similar to \\(x^\\frac{1}{4}.\\) Thus, we can expect only a second steady state to exist.\nThe derivative of the dynamic function with respect to \\(k_t\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t} = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{k_t}\\sqrt{(1+n)\\left(1+n+\\frac{8\\sqrt{k_t}}{\\beta^{3}}\\right)}}\n\\]\nWhen \\(k_t = k_{t+1} = 0\\), the value of the derivative is \\(+\\infty\\), and thus, that steady state is non-stable. Moreover, for any value \\(k&gt;0\\), the derivative is between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). Therefore, any other possible steady state is stable. Because the economy cannot converge to \\(k\\rightarrow \\infty\\), and because all the potential steady states with positive capital are stable, this implies that only can exist. Otherwise, all of the would attract the dynamics, but this is impossible in this model: we must converge somewhere. In fact, the plot corresponds to Figure 2.2.",

    "text": "2.12 The golden-rule level of capital\nThe first welfare theorem states that a competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal. However, the first welfare theorem has two requisites the Diamond model does not meet: a finite number of goods and a finite number of agents. Therefore, the allocation resulting from the competitive equilibrium may not be Pareto optimal. This section is based on Croix and Michel (2009, Ch. 2) and Groth (2016).\nIn the Diamond model —and different from the Ramsey model—, the capital stock on the balanced growth path may exceed the golden-rule level. This implies that a permanent increase in consumption is possible.\nWhen discussing the golden-rule level of capital, we are not interested in how consumption is divided between the old and the young. Rather, we seek to maximise total consumption during one period. In fact, if we maximise total consumption, the ensuing allocations between young and old will be efficient. First, let \\(\\mathfrak{C}_t\\) represent total consumption:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak{C}_t \\equiv C_t + D_t.\n\\] The economy-wide resource constraint dictates that total production is either consumed or invested:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak{C}_t  + K_{t+1} = F(K_t, N_t)+ (1-\\delta)K_t.\n\\]\nAlternatively, aggregate consumption per unit of labour is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathfrak{c}_t \\equiv \\frac{\\mathfrak{C}_t}{N_t} &= \\frac{F(K_t, N_t) +(1-\\delta)K_t - K_{t+1}}{N_t} = \\\\\n& = f(k_t) + (1-\\delta)k_t - (1+n)k_{t+1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe golden-rule level of the capital-labour ratio \\(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}\\) is the value of the capital-labour ratio \\(k\\) that results in the highest possible sustainable level of consumption per unit of labour. The fact that it is sustainable requires that it is replicable forever. For this reason, we consider the steady state with \\(k_{t+1} = k_t = \\bar{k}\\). The resource constraint at the steady state simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\bar{\\mathfrak{c}} = f(\\bar{k})-(\\delta + n)\\bar{k} \\equiv \\mathfrak{c}(k).\n\\]\nWe maximise this function with respect to \\(\\bar{k}\\):\n\\[\n\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0\n\\]\nThe fact that \\(\\mathfrak{c}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) = f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})&lt;0\\) assures that we have the maximum.\nAssuming that \\(n+\\delta &gt;0\\) and that \\(f\\) satisfies:\n\\[\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} f^\\prime(k) &lt; n+ \\delta &lt; \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime(k),\n\\]\nthen \\(\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0\\) has a solution in \\(\\bar{k}\\) and it is unique. Hence, the golden-rule level of capital is given by:\n\\[\nf^\\prime(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}) = n + \\delta.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: The golden-rule level of capital\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest sustainable consumption level per unit of labour is obtained when, at steady state, the net marginal productivity of capital equals the growth rate of the economy.\n\n2.12.1 Over- and under-accumulation of capital\nThe golden-rule level of capital is given by \\(f^\\prime(k) = n+\\delta.\\) However, in the decentralised economy, the steady-state level of savings is highly unlikely to coincide with it. For instance, a log-utility function coupled with a Cobb-Douglas production function leads to a steady-state value of capital such that \\(f^\\prime (k) = \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.\\) In general, \\(\\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\neq n+\\delta.\\)\nIf the steady-state level of the economy is such that \\(f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) &lt; n+ \\delta,\\) the economy has accumulated too much capital: if \\(f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) &lt; f^\\prime(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}) \\implies \\bar{k} &gt; k^{\\mathcal{GR}}.\\) Conversely, if the interest rate at the competitive steady state is such that \\(f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) &gt; n + \\delta,\\) then it lacks capital compared to the golden rule.\n\n2.12.1.1 Improving the situation: dynamic inefficiency\nLet’s suppose for the moment that the decentralised economy reaches a situation of over-accumulation of capital, this is, \\(f^\\prime(\\bar{k}) &lt; n + \\delta.\\) It is possible to improve upon it by means of redistribution. Simply, a planner could order young individuals to save less, as to reach \\(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}.\\) Doing so increases the available total output per worker, which can be consumed either by the old or the young, improving their utility. In subsequent periods, the economy would remain at \\(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}\\), which maximises total output per worker.\nIn particular, assume we impose a lump-sum tax on all young individuals and we transfer it to the old generation. The transfer is fully consumed (old individuals gain utility from consuming it). Suppose the transfer is one good from each young to the old. There are \\(1+n\\) young individuals per old individual, so the old receive \\(1+n\\) goods. Let’s repeat this scheme every period.\n\nThe young transfer one good to the old\nConsumption of the young does not change because they refrain from saving.\nIn the future, they receive \\(1+n\\), which represents a return rate of \\(1+n\\) on their “investment”.\nIn the competitive market, they would have obtained \\(f^\\prime(k) &lt; n + \\delta.\\)\nClearly, the return young individuals achieve under the tax system is larger, and hence they are better off.\n\nAt the same time, old individuals are also better off. In the first period, when the reform is introduced, they consume more. Later generations obtain a higher return for the tax they pay, leaving them better off, too.\nWhen organising such scheme is possible, we say that the competitive economy was dynamically inefficient.\nNote: it is possible to solve the dynamic inefficiency introducing money. Young individuals would exchange goods for paper notes with the expectation of exchanging them back again when old.\n\n\n2.12.1.2 Dynamic efficiency\nIn the opposite case, when \\(\\bar{k} &lt; k^\\mathrm{GR}\\), reaching the golden-rule level of capital requires increasing it. Suppose we are at time \\(t_0\\). Increasing the capital to \\(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}\\) would certainly improve consumption for all generations \\(t &gt; t_0\\). However, young individuals at \\(t_0\\) should forgo some consumption to save more and build the necessary capital. Hence, the consumption of the young generation at \\(t_0\\) necessarily decreases. Our policy of improving utility for all individuals fails in this case.\nWe call such situations dynamically efficient: it is impossible to increase the utility of all generations.\n\n\n\n2.12.2 Example\nWe use a log-utility and Cobb-Douglas case to illustrate over- and under-accumulation of capital.\n\\[\nU(c,d) = \\log( c ) + \\beta \\log (d)\n\\] \\[\nf(k)= Ak^\\alpha.\n\\]\nThe golden-rule level of capital dictates that total consumption per worker should be maximised. Using the resource constraint:\n\\[\n\\max \\mathcal{c_t}= f(k_t) +(1-\\delta)k_t  - (1+n)k_{t+1}.\n\\]\nEvaluating it at the steady state yields:\n\\[\n\\max \\mathfrak{c} = f(k) - (n+\\delta)k \\implies f^\\prime(k^{\\mathcal{GR}}) = n+\\delta.\n\\]\nHence, in our case:\n\\[\nA \\alpha {k^{\\mathcal{GR}}}^{\\alpha-1} = n + \\delta \\implies k^{\\mathcal{GR}} = \\left(\\frac{A\\alpha}{n+\\delta}\\right)^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.\n\\]\nIn the decentralised economy, we have that:\n\\[\nk_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime(k_{t+1})) = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}A(1-\\alpha)k_t^\\alpha.\n\\]\nHence, the steady-state level of capital is:\n\\[\n\\bar{k} = \\frac{A \\beta (1-\\alpha)}{(1+n)(1+\\beta )}\\bar{k}^\\alpha \\implies \\bar{k} = \\frac{A(1-\\alpha) \\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.\n\\]\nWe have capital over-accumulation if: \\(\\bar{k} &gt; k^{\\mathcal{GR}} \\implies \\frac{(n+\\delta) \\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)} &gt; \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}.\\)\nCheck Romer (2018, 89–90) for an empirical discussion about the dynamic efficiency.",

    "text": "2.13 The Central Planner\nSuppose now, instead, that a central planner is in charge of organising consumption and investment for all individuals. The planner operates by aggregating individual utility, discounting future generations at the rate \\(\\gamma.\\) Note: \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount rate of future generations, not how young people discount old-age utility.\nHer utility considers the utility of all generations, including the initial old generation who owns the initial stock of capital \\(k_0.\\)\n\n2.13.1 Planner’s utility\nPlanner’s utility reads:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=-1}^\\infty \\gamma^t U(c_t, d_{t+1}).\n\\]\nNote that, although the planner can decide any allocation, she must respect the resource constraint:\n\\[\nf(k_t) + (1-\\delta) k_t = c_t + \\frac{1}{1+n} d_t + (1+n)k_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAssume that \\(U(c_t, d_{t+1})\\) is separable: \\(U(c_t, d_{t+1}) = u(c_t) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}).\\) Expanding the utility of the planner, we can reformulate it in more convenient terms:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum_{t=-1}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\left(u(c_t)+\\beta u(d_{t+1}) \\right) = \\\\\n&= \\gamma^{-1}u(c_{-1}) +\\gamma^{-1}\\beta u(d_0) + \\gamma^0 u(c_0)+ \\gamma^0 \\beta u(d_1) + \\gamma^1 u(c_1) + \\gamma^1 \\beta u(d_2) + \\ldots \\\\\n&= \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\left(u(c_t) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u(d_t) \\right) + \\gamma^{-1}u(c_{-1}).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\gamma^{-1}u(c_{-1})\\) represents the consumption of the generation born at \\(t=-1\\), but since it is a constant it will not affect the maximisation.\nHence, the planner’s problem is now how to allocate consumption between the young and old that are alive during period \\(t\\).\n\n\n2.13.2 Maximisation\nWe use a substitution to obtain the planner’s optimal allocation, namely, the Euler equation;\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{k_{t+1}, c_t, d_t} \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\left(u(c_t) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u(d_t)\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\n&\\mathrm{s.t.}\\, f(k\\_t) + (1-\\delta)k\\_{t} = c\\_t + \\frac{1}{1+n}d\\_t + (1+n)k\\_{t+1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\max_{c_t, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\left( u(c_t) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}u\\Bigg(\\underbrace{\\left[1+n\\right]\\left[f(k_t)+(1-\\delta)k_t -(1+n)k_{t+1} - c_t\\right]\\Bigg)}_{d_t}\\right).\n\\]\nTaking derivatives and equating them to zero yields:\n\\[\n\\gamma^t u^\\prime(c_t) = \\gamma^t \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u^\\prime(d_t)(1+n)\n\\] \\[\n\\gamma^t\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}u^\\prime (d\\_t)(1+n)(1+n)=\\gamma^{t+1}\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}(1+n)u^\\prime (d\\_{t+1})\\left(f^\\prime (k\\_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right).\n\\]\nCombining both equations we get the Euler equation:\n\\[\nu^\\prime (c_t) = \\beta u^\\prime (d_{t+1})\\left(f^\\prime (k_{t+1}) + 1 -\\delta \\right).\n\\]\nThe planner’s Euler equation coincides with the decentralised one, where we had \\(R_{t+1} = f^\\prime(k_{t+1}) + 1 -\\delta.\\)\nHowever, the planner also allocates consumption between the young and the old at time \\(t\\). \\[\n\\gamma^t u^\\prime(c_t) = \\gamma^t \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} u^\\prime(d_t)(1+n)\n\\]\nIn the centralised equilibrium, individuals do not arbitrage between young and old consumption at time \\(t.\\) We missed this equation because individuals are short-sighted, and only derive utility while alive. Hence, they have no interest in trading off utility with the young generation once they are old.\n\n\n2.13.3 Steady state and modified golden rule\nUsing the fact that \\[\n\\gamma^t\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}u^\\prime (d_t)(1+n)(1+n)=\\gamma^{t+1}\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}(1+n)u^\\prime (d_{t+1})\\left(f^\\prime (k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right)\n\\]\nwe can easily characterise the steady state knowing that \\(d_t = d_{t+1} = \\bar{d}, k_t = k_{t+1} = \\bar{k}.\\)\n\\[\nf^\\prime (\\bar{k}) = \\frac{1+n}{\\gamma}+1-\\delta.\n\\]\nThis equation provides us with the modified golden rule: the level of capital that maximises the planner’s utility. Clearly, if \\(\\gamma=1\\), the planner attributes the same weight to all generations and we recover the golden rule: \\(f^\\prime(k) = n + \\delta.\\) As we discussed before, it is quite unlikely the decentralised equilibrium converges towards the golden rule (modified or not).\n\n\n\n\nCroix, David de la, and Philippe Michel. 2009.

While Tikopians managed to control population growth and natural resources usage, the inhabitants of Eastern Island engaged in clan competition for the control of resources, leading to overpopulation and overexplotation of resources.\nA key aspect of this paper is the especial role of fertility. Most papers assume that parents derive some utility from having children. However, in de la Croix and Dottori, fertility is the result of a Nash bargaining process for the control of resources. In particular, a larger population, facilitated by having more children, raises the value of the fallback option during the negotiation process. Consequently, individuals optimally decide to have more children, because this implies a better bargaining position. In this sense, equilibrium-level fertility rates result from the complementarities between different groups’ fertility decisions. However, the externalities of a higher fertiltiy rate are not internalised and, in the long run, population explodes, leading to a natural catastrophe.",

The effects of the population race could be perceived by 1600CE: food consumption declined and population plummeted during the 17th century. By 1772, when Europeans arrived at Eastern Island, the total population was around 3000 people. In parallel, data about forests in Eastern Island indicate that upon the arrival of the first settlers during 400CE, tree-cutting begun. By 1400CE, deforestation had reached its peak and when the Europeans arrived, there were basically no trees in the island.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 in de la Croix and Dottori, 2008\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 in de la Croix and Dottori, 2008\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tikopia was settled around 900BCE and people lived by slash and burn agriculture. By 100BCE, due to decreasing returns from natural resources, pig breeding began, lasting until the 17th century, when Tikopians abandoned it because pigs required too many resources. Total population stabilized at around 1200 people and was kept at that level by purposeful mechanisms: celibacy, abortion, infanticide, sea exploration by young males, etc.",

    "text": "3.2 The model\nDe la Croix and Dottori work using the OLG framework. In the paper, agents live for two periods. However, important decisions are taken at the clan level, which acts as a representative agent. Clans (and individuals) are rational, have perfect foresight and take the actions of the other clans as given. The timing is as follows:\n\nEach clan chooses its fertility level,\nA Nash-Cournot fertility equilibrium level arises,\nCrops are cultivated and shared between clans following a non-cooperative bargaining process.\n\nFor simplicity, the island is populated by two opposed clans, all individuals belong to one clan only and they cannot change clan.\n\n3.2.1 Preferences\nClan \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) consists of \\(N_{i,t}\\) adults. Adults work, support their parents and have children. Old agents only consume what their children provide for them.1 Total utility is given by: \\[\nU_{i,t} = c_{i,t} + \\beta d_{i,t+1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i,t}, d_{i,t+1}\\) represents consumption when adult and old, respectively.\n\n\n3.2.2 Budget\nThe income of an adult agent is \\(y_{i,t}\\). Each adult has to support his parents by giving them some resources. However, support for parents is not linear, but rather it depends on the number of siblings. In particular, each sibling contributes the following share of his income: \\[\n\\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau \\in (0,1)\\). Clearly, the contribution decreases with the number of siblings.\nConsequently, an agent in his old age who had \\(n_{i,t}\\) children receives, as total old age support,\n\\[\nd_{i,t+1} = n_{i,t}\\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t}}y_{i,t+1}.\n\\]\nLastly, since total income is distributed between consumption and supporting parents \\(\\left(y_{i,t} = c_{i,t} + \\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}} y_{i,t}\\right)\\), consumption when young is just:\n\\[\nc_{i,t} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}}\\right)y_{i,t}.\n\\]\n\n\n3.2.3 Population\nThe population of each clan evolves according to the chosen fertility level: \\[\nN_{i,t+1} = N_{i,t}n_{i,t}.\n\\]\n\n\n3.2.4 Production\nProduction depends only on land. The amount of land is fixed at \\(L\\), and total factor productivity depends on the available natural resources \\(R_t\\). \\[\nY_{i,t} = A(R_t)L.\n\\]\nThe dynamics of resources follow the paper by Matsumoto (2002): \\[\nR_{t+1} = \\left(1 +\\delta - \\delta \\frac{R_t}{K} - b (N_{1,t} + N_{2,t})\\right)R_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(K &gt; 0\\) is the carrying capacity (maximum possible number of resources), \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) is the growth rate of resources while \\(b&gt;0\\) measures the effect of population on resources.\n\n3.2.4.1 Crop-sharing\nWe denote by \\(\\theta_t\\) the share of crops \\(Y_t\\) that Group 1 appropriates. Therefore, each adult in Groups 1 and 2 obtains: \\[\ny_{1,t} = \\theta_t \\frac{Y_t}{N_{1,t}},\n\\] \\[\ny_{2,t} = (1-\\theta_t) \\frac{Y_t}{N_{2,t}}.\n\\]\nThere are no property rights on the island, and groups have to bargain to decide how to split the total porduction \\(Y_{t}\\). This bargaining process is non-cooperative and, if no agreement is reached, clans will battle to appropriate the entire production.",

When there is no agreement between Group 1 and Group 2, the clans fight and the winner takes all. The probability that Group 1 wins the war, denoted by \\(\\pi_t\\), depends on its size.\n\\[\n\\pi_t = \\frac{N_{1,t}}{N_{1,t} + N_{2,t}}.\n\\]\nSo, the more adults in one group, the more likely it is to win the war. From the equation, it is clear that clans have an incentive to increase their population: it helps win the war (if it happens) and provides them with a better bargaining position by raising \\(\\bar{U}_{i,t}.\\)\nSuppose than clans reach an agreement \\(\\theta_t\\) on how to share crops: \\(\\theta_t\\) goes to Group 1, and the remining \\(1-\\theta_{t}\\) goes to Group 2.

    "text": "4.1 The model\nThis section discusses the work of Galor and Moav (2006), which presents an OLG model to explain the rise of publicly financed education and the transition from a class structure characterised by capitalists and workers to another one where all individuals are capitalists.\nThe papers proposes that the demise of the class structure was a deliberate action from the part of the capitalists to sustain their profits as human capital became more and more important in the production process. This is, at some point in time, human capital becomes really necessary to produce, and the capitalists find it optimal to tax themselves to finance the education of workers. Doing so, raises the human capital level and allows them to keep their profits.\nThe paper is set-up after the industrial revolution, let’s say around 1850 and is meant to describe the transition of the modern economies between that time and the beginning of the 20th century. The authors motivate the paper by showing that during this time, school enrolment rates increased while, at the same time, inequality decreased: the demise of classes. The theory the authors propose parallels this evolution. Furthermore, they supplement the model with econometrics that are compatible with the predictions of the model.\nWe present a simplified version of the model using precise functional forms for the human capital accumulation process and the production function. This paper comprises two separate sections: * The general model * The application of the model to a society with two classes. We will follow this approach.\nFor the moment, the economy comprises only one type of individuals. Individuals live for two periods of time: young and adult. Young individuals do not produce and use their time to acquire human capital. If education is provided, human capital accumulation is faster.",

Individuals have only parent and each has only one son. Individuals live for two periods: during their youth, they accumulate human capital; and education improves human capital accumulation. Young individuals may receive a positive bequest from their parents on which they earn interests (the bequest is physical capital that is lent to producers). When adults, they supply their human capital as efficiency units of labour; receive interests on their assets and allocate the total income between consumption and a bequest.\nThe bequest \\(b_t\\) is transferred from parents to children, and the government collects a tax \\(\\tau_t \\geq 0\\) on it. The remaining \\(1-\\tau_t\\) is saved for future consumption. Physical capital fully depreciates between periods.\nAs mentioned, individuals accumulate human capital during their youth, and if they are provided with education (\\(e_t\\)), human capital accumulation is enhanced. However, even if no education is provided, all young individuals manage to obtain a minimum level of human capital: we set it equal to one. We model human capital accumulation as follows:1\n\\[\nh_{t+1} = 1 + \\frac{e_t}{1+e_t} = h(e_t).\n\\]\nThis type of function ensures that under some conditions, investment in education is not optimal; while guaranteeing a minimum level of human capital.\nWhen adults, individuals receive wages on their human capital, as well as the rental price on the bequest (the part not taxed by the government). Therefore, an individual with a bequest \\(b_t\\) and education level \\(e_t\\) has income equal to:\n\\[\nI^i_{t+1} = w_{t+1}h(e_t) + (1-\\tau)b^i_t R_{t+1},\n\\] and, since capital fully depreciates, \\(R_{t+1} = r_{t+1} = r(k_{t+1}).\\)\nLastly, the preferences of adults include consumption and a taste for giving bequests. Bequests in the model are a type of luxury good: only when income is large enough, \\(b_t &gt; 0.\\) In particular: \\[\nu^i_t = (1-\\beta) \\log (c^i_{t+1}) + \\beta \\log (\\bar{\\theta} + b^i_{t+1}),\n\\] where \\(\\bar{\\theta} &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\beta \\in (0,1).\\) The budget constraint is simple: \\[\nc_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i = I_{t+1}^i.\n\\]\n\n\n4.1.3 Optimisation\nWe can easily compute the value of bequests, as a function of the income level. Replacing \\(c_{t+1}\\) in the objective function and taking the derivative with respect to \\(b_{t+1}\\) yields:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b^i_{t+1}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1-\\beta}{b^i_{t+1}-I^i_{t+1}}+\\frac{\\beta}{b^i_{t+1}+\\bar{\\theta}} = 0 \\implies\n\\] \\[ b^i_{t+1} = \\begin{cases}\n\\beta (I^i_{t+1} - \\theta) & \\mathrm{if\\quad} I^i_{t+1} &gt; \\theta \\\\\n0                          & \\mathrm{if\\quad} I^i_{t+1} \\leq \\theta\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta \\equiv \\bar{\\theta}\\frac{1-\\beta}{\\beta}.\\) Hence, when income is relative low, individuals do not give bequests.\n\n\n4.1.4 Evolution of physical and human capital\nRemember that bequests left during period \\(t\\) are the capital of period \\(t+1.\\) If \\(B_t\\) is the total amount of bequests left during \\(t\\), then \\[\nK_{t+1} = (1-\\tau) B_t.\n\\]\nThe remaining \\(\\tau B_t\\) goes to the government, which uses it to fund education. Population is normalised to 1, therefore, each individual receives education equal to: \\(e_t = \\tau B_t,\\) and human capital evolves as:\n\\[\nH_{t+1} = h(e_t) = h(\\tau_t B_t) = 1 + \\frac{\\tau_t B_t}{1 + \\tau_t B_t}.\n\\]\nLast, the level of \\(k_t = \\frac{K_t}{H_t}\\) is:\n\\[\nk_{t+1} = \\frac{K_{t+1}}{H_{t+1}} = \\frac{(1-\\tau_t)B_t}{h(\\tau_t B_t)} = \\frac{(1-\\tau_t)B_t}{ 1 + \\frac{\\tau_t B_t}{1 + \\tau_t B_t}}= k(\\tau_t, B_t).\n\\]",

Although the major contribution of the paper is empirical, the authors develop an OLG model from which they derive implications that are tested.\nThe theoretical model shows how the composition of a population can be modeled using the OLG framework. The most influential model in that regard is Bisin and Verdier (2001). However, the model in Galor and Özak is relatively simple and illustrates well some population dynamics.\nWe work under the OLG framework, and we assume that the economy is agricultural and at the very early stages of development. In every period, the economy consists of individuals who live for three periods.\nLastly, a crucial assumption of the mode is the lack of financial markets and long-term storage technology.

    "text": "5.2 Preferences\nA key aspect of the model to generate dynamics in the evolution of individual traits is the fertility decision. This approach is common: typically, fertility is linked to a trait through income. This is, individuals with more income will be able to have more children. If the trait is transmitted from parents to children, then the trait that allows generating more income will become more and more prevalent in the economy.1 In any case, preferences are really important in this type of models, because fertility decisions are derived from them.\nEvery period \\(t\\), a generation of size \\(L_t\\) becomes economically active, this is, reaches the second period of life. Those individuals were born in period \\(t-1\\). At this stage, each individual will live for two periods. Remember that financial markets do not exist, and also that it is impossible to transfer resources between periods by storing them.\nWe assume that, during the second period of life, individuals only consume what they produce. Lastly, during the third and last period individuals consume and also have children. In particular, utility is given by: \\[\nu^{i,t} = \\ln c_{i,t} + \\beta^i_t [\\gamma \\ln n_{i,t+1} + (1-\\gamma) \\ln c_{i,t+1}],\\quad \\gamma \\in(0,1),\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i,t}\\) and \\(c_{i,t+1}\\) are the levels of consumption in the second and third periods of life and \\(n_{i,t}\\) is the number of children. It is important to comment on \\(\\beta^i_t \\in (0,1]\\): it represents individual i’s discount factor, this is, how much he values the future with respect to the present. The larger \\(\\beta^i_t\\), the more the value of future and, hence, the more patient the individual is. Notice that \\(\\beta^i_t\\) changes over time and also by individual.\nDuring the second period, individuals do not really make any decision: since resources cannot be transferred, all production must be consumed. Hence, \\(c_{i,t} = y_{i,t}\\). However, during the last period individuals can trade-off utility from consumption and utility from children. The paper assumes that each child costs \\(\\tau\\) units of consumption, which gives rise the last-period budget constraint: \\[\ny_{i,t+1} = c_{i,t+1} + \\tau n_{i,t+1}.\n\\]\nConsidering the preferences, utility maximisation implies: \\[\nc_{i,t+1} = (1-\\gamma) y_{i,t+1},\n\\] \\[\nn_{i,t+1} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\tau} y_{i,t+1}.\n\\]\nLastly, the indirect utility (\\(v_{i,t}\\)) of individual \\(i\\) is given by: \\[\nv_{i,t} = \\ln y_{i,t} + \\beta^i_t [\\ln y_{i,t+1} + \\xi],\\quad \\xi \\equiv \\gamma \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\tau} \\right) + (1-\\gamma)\\ln(1-\\gamma).\n\\]",

Hence, if \\(\\beta^i_0 \\leq \\hat{\\beta} \\implies \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^i_t = \\beta^i_0.\\)\nSuppose instead that \\(\\beta^i_0 &gt; \\hat{\\beta}.\\) The individual will become a farmer and transmit \\(\\phi(\\beta^i_0,R^1) &gt; \\beta^i_0.\\) Accordingly, all his sons will also be farmers and keep transmitting an ever-increasing value of \\(\\beta^i_{t+1}.\\) However, because \\(\\phi_{\\beta \\beta}(\\beta^i_t,R^1) &lt; 0\\), the transmission process has a steady-state, this is, \\(\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^i_t = \\bar{\\beta^I}.\\) Notice that \\(\\bar{\\beta^I}\\) is the maximum level \\(\\beta^i_t\\) can reach.\n\n5.4.1 Proof (not in the paper)\nWe want to show that \\(\\beta^i_{t+1} = \\phi(\\beta^i_t,R^1)\\) has a unique steady-state. This amounts to showing that \\(\\bar{\\beta^I} = \\phi(\\bar{\\beta^I},R^1)\\) for a unique value \\(\\bar{\\beta^I}.\\) Define \\(G(\\beta) = \\phi(\\beta,R) - \\beta.\\) Since we focus on farmers, we know that the very initial one in the dynasty had \\(\\beta^i_0 &gt; \\hat{\\beta}\\). So, for our purposes, the function \\(G\\) has as domain \\(\\beta \\in [\\hat{\\beta},\\infty).\\) We know that \\(G(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\phi(\\hat{\\beta}, R^1) - \\hat{\\beta} &gt; 0\\) because \\(\\phi(\\hat{\\beta},R^1) &gt; \\beta^i_t.\\) Moreover, the function \\(G\\) has unique maximum at \\(\\phi_\\beta = 1\\) because \\(\\phi_{\\beta \\beta} &lt; 0\\), and the maximum is positive because it must be larger than \\(\\phi(\\hat{\\beta},R^1)-\\hat{\\beta} &gt; 0.\\) After the maxima, the function continuously decreases, thus crossing only one the horizontal axis, this is, there is a unique value \\(\\bar{\\beta}\\) such that \\(G(\\bar{\\beta^I}) = 0\\), which constitutes the unique steady state.",

    "text": "5.5 Evolution of traits over time\nLastly, suppose that initially, at time \\(t=0\\), the initial population presents different levels of time preference. We assume that, initially, traits are characterised by some distribution of \\(\\eta(\\beta^i_0)\\) with support \\([0,\\bar{\\beta^I}].\\) Furthermore, we normalise the initial generation to be of size one: \\(L_0 = 1.\\) Alternatively:\n\\[\nL_0 = \\int_0^{\\bar{\\beta^I}} \\eta(\\beta^i_0)\\mathrm{d}\\beta^i_0 = 1.\n\\]\nWe also know that all individuals whose \\(\\beta^i_0 \\leq \\hat{\\beta}\\) decide to use the endowment technology, and the remaining opt for the investment technology. Therefore, the size of hunters (E) and farmers (I) is given by:\n\\[\nL^E_0 = \\int_0^{\\hat{\\beta}} \\eta(\\beta^i_0) \\mathrm{d}\\beta^i_0,\n\\]\n\\[\nL^I_0 = \\int_{\\hat{\\beta}}^{\\bar{\\beta^I}} \\eta(\\beta^i_0) \\mathrm{d}\\beta^i_0.\n\\]\nThe number of individuals evolves according to the fertility rate of each group, this is, \\[\nL_t^E = L_0^E {n^E}^t = (\\frac{\\gamma}{\\tau}R^0)^tL_0^E\n\\]\n\\[\nL_t^I = L_0^I {n^I}^t = (\\frac{\\gamma}{\\tau}R^1)^tL_0^I\n\\]\nand total population is \\(L_t = L_t^E + L_t^I.\\)\nFinally, notice that the distribution of \\(\\beta^i_t\\) does not change for those individuals with \\(\\beta^i_t \\leq \\bar{\\beta}\\): in fact, they all have the same number of children, and each child inherits the trait of his parent. Therefore, the average value \\(\\bar{\\beta^E}\\) is constant over time. In contrast, the average value \\(\\bar{\\beta^I_t}\\) increases. In any case, at any given period \\(t\\), the overall average value for time preference is given by:\n\\[\n\\bar{\\beta_t} = \\theta^E_t \\bar{\\beta^E_t} + (1-\\theta^E_t)\\bar{\\beta_t^I},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta^E_t\\) is the fraction of individuals who engage in the endowment production process, and \\(\\bar{\\beta_t}\\) is just the weighted average.\n\\[\n\\theta^E_t = \\frac{L_t^E}{L_t^E + L_t^I} = \\frac{{R^0}^t}{{R^0}^t+{R^1}^t\\frac{L^I_0}{L^E_0}}.\n\\]\nHence, as time advances, the share of the population engaged in the endowment production process shrinks towards zero:\n\\[\n\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\theta^E_t = 0.\n\\]\nThis process reflects their lower reproductive success.\n\n\n\n\nBisin, Alberto, and Thierry Verdier. 2001. “The Economics of Cultural Transmission and the Dynamics of Preferences.” Journal of Economic Theory 97 (2): 298–319. https://doi.org/10.1006/jeth.2000.2678.\n\n\nGalor, Oded, and Ömer Özak. 2016. “The Agricultural Origins of Time Preference.” American Economic Review 106 (10): 3064–3103. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150020.",
