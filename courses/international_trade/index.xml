      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ricardian-model&#34;&gt;The Ricardian Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ricardian Trade Model, developed by English economist David Ricardo in the early 19th century, is a foundational concept in international trade theory.
Ricardo introduced this model in his 1817 book &amp;ldquo;On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, the Ricardian model emphasizes the importance of &lt;strong&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/strong&gt; in international trade.
This was a significant departure from the prevailing mercantilist ideas of the time, which focused on absolute advantage.
As we will see, the key insight of Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model is that countries can benefit from trade even if one country is more efficient at producing all goods.
He argued that countries should specialize in producing and exporting goods in which they have a comparative advantage - that is, goods they can produce at a lower opportunity cost compared to other countries.
This model shows  why international trade can be &lt;strong&gt;mutually eneficial for all participating countries&lt;/strong&gt;, this is, specialization and trade are Pareto-improving strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-countries-2-goods-1-production-factor&#34;&gt;2 Countries, 2 Goods, 1 Production Factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, we begin by assuming there are two countries on the world: Home and Foreign.
Variables pertaining to the Foreign country will have an asterisk ($\star$) superscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each country can produce two goods: xbox and a yogurt.
The production of each good requires one production factor: labor.
However, each good requires differents amounts of labor.
Labour is perfectly mobile across sectors but immobile across countries (there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; migration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We denote these requirements as follows for Home:
$z_x$ indicates the &lt;strong&gt;number of workers&lt;/strong&gt; required to produce &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; xbox, and $z_y$ indicates the &lt;strong&gt;number of workers&lt;/strong&gt; required to produce &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; yogurt.
These measures are the inverse of the productivity in each sector: how many units of output can be produced with one unit of input.
So, lower values $z_{i}$ indicate higher productivity.
Finally, we assume that each country has a working population of $L$ workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Foreign has labour requirements $z_{x}^{\star}$ and $z_{y}^{\star}$ for xbox and yogurt, respectively.
Its working population is $L^{\star}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-opportunity-cost&#34;&gt;The opportunity cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose 10 workers are required to produce one xbox in Home, and 2 workers are required to produce one yogurt.
This means that $z_x = 10$ and $z_y = 2$.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that we want to increase the production of xbox in Home by 1 unit.
This would require 10 additional workers, who are now producing yogurts.
Therefore, to increase the production of xbox by 1 unit, we need to decrease the production of yogurt by 5 units.
Then the opportunity cost of producing one additional xbox is
\begin{equation}
-\frac{z_x}{z_y} \text{yogurts}.
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: it is always a good idea to check that the units verify your computations
The opportunity cost reads $\frac{z_x \frac{\text{workers}}{\text{xbox}}}{z_y \frac{\text{workers}}{\text{yogurt}}} = \frac{z_x}{z_y} \frac{\text{yogurts}}{\text{xbox}}.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;marginal-productivity-of-labor&#34;&gt;Marginal productivity of labor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With out notation, $z_x$ indicates &lt;strong&gt;how many workers&lt;/strong&gt; are required to produce one xbox.
The marginal productiivity of labor is the additional output that can be obtained by adding one additional worker to the production process.
In our case, the marginal productivity of labor is the additional output that can be obtained by adding one additional worker to the production of a given good.
With our notation, $MPL_x = \frac{1}{z_x}$ and $MPL_y = \frac{1}{z_y}$.
This is, if we add 1 worker to the production of xbox, we can produce $\frac{1}{z_x}$ additional xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: in other text books, the slope of the PPF is indicated in terms of the marginal product of labour as $-\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}$.
Both are equivalent because $-\frac{M_y}{M_x} = -\frac{\frac{1}{z_y}}{\frac{1}{z_x}} = -\frac{z_x}{z_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-production-possibility-frontier&#34;&gt;The Production Possibility Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production possibility frontier (PPF) is a graphical representation of all the possible combinations of goods that a country can produce given its available resources and technology.
It shows the maximum amount of one good that can be produced for each possible level of production of the other good.
For example, if a country can produce 100 units of xbox and 50 units of yogurt with its available resources, the PPF would show that the maximum amount of xbox that can be produced is 100, and for each level of xbox production between 0 and 100, the maximum amount of yogurt that can be produced is a decreasing function of the xbox production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the country has $L$ workers available that can be used to produce xbox and yogurt.
Because producing an xbox requires $z_x$ workers, if the entire workforce $L$ were allocated to produce xbox, the maximum amount of xbox that could be produced would be $L/z_x$.
Note that, bby doing so, the country would not be able to produce any yogurt.
Similarly, if the entire workforce $L$ were allocated to produce yogurt, the maximum amount of yogurt that could be produced would be $L/z_y$ and the country would not be able to produce any xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, the PPF can be retrieved by solving the following equation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
\begin{align}
L &amp;amp;= z_x x + z_y y \implies\\
y &amp;amp;= \frac{L - z_x x}{z_y} = \frac{L}{z_y} - \frac{z_x}{z_y} x.
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Ricardian model, the PPF is a straigth line with negative slope equal to $-\frac{z_x}{z_y}$.
Notice that we have already seen the slope term: it is the opportunity cost of producing one additional xbox.
Does it make sense that we retrieve it here?
Absolutely!
Let&amp;rsquo;s try to back it up using some differential calculus and computing by how much the production of yogurt changes when we increase the production of xbox by 1 unit.
\begin{align}
L &amp;amp;= z_x x + z_y y \implies\\
0 &amp;amp;= z_x \mathrm{d} x + z_y \mathrm{d} y \implies\\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} &amp;amp;= -\frac{z_x}{z_y}.
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below plots the PPF for Home when $L=100$, $z_x=10$ and $z_y=2$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_ppf.webp&#34; alt=&#34;PPF&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy can produce on any point on the PPF (also inside it).
&lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt;: show that producing inside the PPF does not use the entire labour force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, below we indicate several combinations of xbox and yogurts that are feasible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 xbox and 30 yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 xbox and 20 yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_ppf_with_points.webp&#34; alt=&#34;PPF_with_points&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-country&#34;&gt;Home country&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autarky-equilibrium&#34;&gt;Autarky equilibrium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy can produce anywhere on the PPF.
The exact production schedule will depend on the preferences of the consumers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that consumers at Home have preferences described by a utility function such that:
\begin{equation}
U = u(x,y)
\end{equation}
For instance, $U = x^{0.4} y^{0.6}$ is a possible utility function (of the Cobb-Douglas family).
If an individual consumes $x = 1$ xbox and $y = 20$ yogurt, the utility that he obtains is $U = 10^{0.4} 20^{0.6} = 6.03$.
Because we are working on the $(x,y)$ space, we can plot the utility function as a curve called &lt;strong&gt;indifferece curve&lt;/strong&gt;.
The indifference curve plots all the points $(x,y)$ that provide the same level of utility $\bar{u}$.
The next figure plots several indifference curves for the utility function $U = x^{0.4} y^{0.6}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_indiff.webp&#34; alt=&#34;indifference_curves&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In autarky, the economy will produce at the point where the indifference curve is tangent to the PPF.
We can show this mathematically.
First, we must realize that consumers will want to maximize their utility.
Second, that the production possibilities are limited by the PPF.
Hence:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} U &amp;amp;= u(x,y) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad z_x x + z_y y &amp;amp;= L \\
\\
\max_x &amp;amp; \quad u(x, \frac{L - z_x x}{z_y}) \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} &amp;amp;= 0 \implies \\
u^\prime_x - u^\prime_y \frac{z_x}{z_y} &amp;amp;= 0 \implies \\
\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{z_x}{z_y}
\end{align}
The term $-\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y}$ is called the &lt;strong&gt;marginal rate of substitution&lt;/strong&gt; and corresponds to the slope of the indifference curve.
We can check this because:
\begin{align}
U &amp;amp;= u(x,y) \implies \\
0 &amp;amp;= u^\prime_x dx + u^\prime_y dy \implies \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp;amp;= -\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the slope of the PPF is $- \frac{z_x}{z_y}$ and the slope of the indifference curve is $-\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y}$.
The optimization problem will be solved when both slopes are equal, this is, when the indifference curve is tangent to the PPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_indiff_tangent.webp&#34; alt=&#34;autarky_equilibrium&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equilibrium-relative-price&#34;&gt;Equilibrium relative price&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the relative equilibrium price level that supports the autarky optimum.
Within each industry, the wage of a worker is equal to the marginal product of labour.
With a profit function of the type:
\begin{equation}
\pi_x = p_x x - w_x z_x x
\end{equation}
The profit maximizing condition is $p_x = w_x z_x$.
Hence, the wage is $w_x = \frac{p_x}{z_x}$.
The same applies to the yogurt industry, $w_y = \frac{p_y}{z_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because workers &lt;strong&gt;can move freely&lt;/strong&gt; between industries, the wage in both industries must be equal.
Otherwise, workers would move from the industry with the highest wage to the industry with the lowest wage.
Therefore, $w_x = w_y$ and $\frac{p_x}{z_x} = \frac{p_y}{z_y}$.
And
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y}
\end{equation}
This is the ratio of the marginal productivities of labour:
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} = \frac{\frac{1}{z_y}}{\frac{1}{z_x}} = \frac{z_x}{z_y}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we let $z_x = 10$ and $z_y = 2$, then the equilibrium price ratio is $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y} = \frac{10}{2} = 5$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-the-foreign-country&#34;&gt;Introducing the Foreign country&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Home, the Foreign country will also have 2 industries, but with different marginal productivities of labour.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that in Foreign, 20 workers are needed to assemble an xbox and 6 workers are required to produce a yogurt.
Hence, $z_x^\star = 20$ and $z_y^\star = 6$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;absolute-adavantage&#34;&gt;Absolute adavantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say that a country has an &lt;strong&gt;absolute advantage&lt;/strong&gt; in the production of a good if producing this good requires less labour than in the other country.
In our example, Home has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods: $z_x = 10 &amp;lt; z_x^\star = 20$ and $z_y = 2 &amp;lt; z_y^\star = 6$.
This is, Home is more productive.
Note that a country can have an absolute advantage in the production of more than one good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparative-advantage&#34;&gt;Comparative advantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to absolute advantage, &lt;strong&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/strong&gt; is a relative concept.
It compares the &lt;strong&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/strong&gt; of producing a good across countries.
A country with a &lt;strong&gt;lower opporunity cost&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;strong&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/strong&gt; in the production of that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, $z_x = 10$ and $z_y = 2$ and $z_x^\star = 20$ and $z_y^\star = 6$.
Therefore, the opportunity cost of one xbox at home is $\frac{z_x}{z_y} = \frac{10}{2} = 5$ yogurts.
Meanwhile, the opportunity cost of 1 xbox in Foreign is $\frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star} = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33$ yogurts.
Hence, Foreign has a comparative advantage in the production of xboxes because it has to give up less yogurts to produce an xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the opportunity cost of one yogurt at home is $\frac{z_y}{z_x} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2$ xboxes.
The same 1 yogurt in Foreign costs $\frac{z_y^\star}{z_x^\star} = \frac{6}{20} = 0.3$ xboxes.
Consequently, Home has a comparative advantage in the production of yogurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, with two countries and two goods, if one country has a comparative advantage in the production of one good, then the other country must have a comparative advantage in the production of the other good.
\begin{equation}
\frac{z_x}{z_y} &amp;lt; \frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star} \implies \frac{z_y}{z_x} &amp;gt; \frac{z_y^\star}{z_x^\star}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-complex-example&#34;&gt;A complex example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textile industry in the US generates 92000 USD per worker per hour while in China a similar worker generates only 13500 USD per hour.
Meanwhile, a worker in the agricultural sector produces about 540 kg per hour and only 2 kg per hour in China.
Note that we are given marginal productivities: if we add one more worker, we generate 92000 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the USA has an absolute advantage in both sectors: one worker generates more revenue in textiles and produces more per hour in agriculture.
In fact, textiles workers are about 6.8 times more productive in the USA and farmers are 270 times more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s compute the opportunity cost of textiles in both countries.
To produce one additional dollar in textiles we need $\frac{1}{92000}$ additional workers.
This additional workers could have produced $540\frac{1}{92000} = 0.005$ kg.
In China, it amounts to $2\frac{1}{13500} = 0.00015$ kg.
Hence, the opportunity cost of textiles is lower than in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;specialisation-and-trade&#34;&gt;Specialisation and Trade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how we solved for the relative price level at Home, the relative equilibrium price level in Foreign is $\frac{p_x^\star}{p_y^s\star} = \frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star}$.
In our example $\frac{p_x^\star}{p_y^\star} = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this differential in relative prices, if we allow trade, an arbitrage opportunity will arise.
We can borrow one hundred yogurts in Home, sell it in Foreign and obtain $\frac{100}{\frac{p_x^\star}{p_y^\star}} = 30$ xbox
Then, back at Home, $30$ xboxes can be exchanged for $30 \times 5 = 150$ yogurts.
We can return the 100 we borrowed and still gain 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone will start exploiting this possibility.
Because the supply of xboxes in Home increases, the relative price of xboxes will fall.
At the same time, the demand of xboxes in Foreign increases, driving up its price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other terms, Home exports yogurt and imports xboxes.
The flow of goods will stop once the relative prices in both countries are equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not know yet towards which price level the world will converge to.
However, the world equilibrium price level &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be between the relative price levels of the two countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^\star &amp;lt; \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w &amp;lt; \frac{p_x}{p_y}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see why, suppose it is not, for instance, assume that $\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w = 1$
Because the world price of xboxes is lower than the Home price of xboxes, Home would one to import them.
However, the world price is also lower than the price at Foreign, so that Foreign also wants to import xboxes.
This is impossible, because none will be exporting any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next natural question is whether Home and Foreign benefit from trading at the world price.
The answer is yes, and we can see it graphically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of the argument, assume that $\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w = 4$
Home can gain if the country specializes in yogurts.
With a working force of $L = 100$, it can produce $50$ yogurts.
These $50$ yogurts can be exchanged for 12.5 xboxes, meaning that the budget constraint has shifted.
In fact, it is no longer the case that consumption must be tangent to the PPF: &lt;strong&gt;international trade &lt;em&gt;expands&lt;/em&gt; the consuption set&lt;/strong&gt; beyond the PPF.
With the previous utility function $U = x^{0.4}y^{0.6}$, the optimum is to consume:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} U &amp;amp;= x^{0.4}y^{0.6} \\
\text{s.t. } &amp;amp; 50 p_y = y p_y + x p_x \implies 50 = y + \frac{p_x}{p_y} x \implies y = 50 - 4 x \\
\\
x &amp;amp;= 5 \quad y = 30
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home will consume more of both goods than before (actually, in this example it is the same amount of yogurt, but it needs not be the case).
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_equilibrium.webp&#34; alt=&#34;equilibrium&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a utility function $U = x^{0.5} y^{0.5}$ and a work force of $L^\star = 200$, in autarky, Foreign consumption was:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} U &amp;amp;= x^{0.5}y^{0.5} \\
\text{s.t. } &amp;amp; L^\star = 20 x + 6 y \\
x &amp;amp;= 5 \quad y = 16.67
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the xboxes are produced in Foreign, the 5 imported at Home require 100 workers.
The remaining 100 workers can produce the 5 xboxes that were consumed in Foreign under autarky.
Moreover, the 5 exported xboxes will be exchanged for 20 yogurts, more than what they consumed in autarky, so Foreign is better off under trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_equilibrium_foreign.webp&#34; alt=&#34;equilibrium_foreign&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pattern-of-trade&#34;&gt;Pattern of trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general conclusion of Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model is that countries should specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage, producing and exporting it.
The good that is exported is traded against the good for which the country has a comparative disadvantage, which is imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, according to Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model, &lt;strong&gt;the pattern of trade is determined by comparative advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as we have seen with the example, &lt;strong&gt;international trade expands the consumption set&lt;/strong&gt;, improving the well-being of both countries.
In that sense, trade is Pareto-improving: every country wins, none looses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wages&#34;&gt;Wages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many opponents to international trade argue that, by importing a good, workers in that sector suffer.
For instance, one could claim that Home xbox producers suffer because Home specialized in yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;

    American aluminum smelters have faced an onslaught of cheap aluminum being brought into the United States.
    In 2016, imports accounted for 90 percent of total primary aluminum demand, up from 66 percent in 2012.
    There is only one high-volume producer of the high-purity aluminum needed for defense aerospace applications.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with trade, firms are still working under perfect competition.
Therefore, the wage in each sector and country still corresponds to the marginal product of labor.
Because Home produces yogurts and Foreign xboxes:
\begin{align}
w_y &amp;amp;= p_y MPL_y \\
w_x^\star &amp;amp;= p_x MPL_x^\star
\end{align}
Note that prices are common due to trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The xbox industry disappeared at Home, why?
The answer is simple: no one wants to work in that industry.
In autarky, wages were equal in both sectors with $w_x = p_x MPL_x$ and $w_y = p_y MPL_y$.
Hence $\frac{w_x}{w_y} = 1$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In autarky, we also had $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}$.
But, with trade $\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w &amp;lt; \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}$ so:
$p_x^w MPL_x &amp;lt; p_y^w MPL_y$
Because wages are the marginal products:
$\frac{w_x}{w_y} = \frac{p_x^w MPL_x}{p_y^w MPL_y} &amp;lt; 1$ and a worker at Home earns more in the yogurt sector.
As a consequence, the xbox sector disappears at Home whenever the relative price xboxes is lower than in autarky.
Similarly, the yogurt industry disappears in Foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wage at Home is $w_y = p_y MPL_y$ and the wage at Foreign is $w_x^\star = p_x MPL_x^\star$.
Consequently, wages at Home are higher if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p_y MPL_y &amp;gt; p_x MPL_x^\star$ (wages measured in dollars)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$MPL_y &amp;gt; \frac{p_x}{p_y} MPL_x^\star$ (wages measured in yogurts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{p_y}{p_x} MPL_y &amp;gt; MPL_x^\star$ (wages measured in xboxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, wages are determined by the absolute advantage: higher productivity translates as higher wages (ignoring for a second the price level which we do not know how to determine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-prices&#34;&gt;International prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece to close the model is the determination of the international price level.
Again, remember that we will find a relative price $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always in economics, we first need to find the supply and demand curves.
In general, when dealing with trade, one looks for a relative supply and relative demand curve.
However, for the Ricardian model, we can work out the equilibrium price by stuyding just one market.
The budget constraint (total production equals total consumption) will ensure that the other market is also in equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supply-of-exports&#34;&gt;Supply of exports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider Home.
If the international price ratio $\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w$ is smaller than $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y}$ in autarky, Home specializes in yogurts.
When the international price ratio equals the one prevailing in autarky, Home is indifferent between producing xboxes or yogurts.
Finally, when $\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^w &amp;gt; \frac{z_x}{z_y}$, Home specializes in xboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, we had that $\frac{z_x}{z_y} &amp;gt; \frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star}$ so that Home specializes in yogurts.
The production of yogurts is then $y = \frac{L}{z_y}$.
Out of the amount produced, some will consumed internally and some exported.
Internal consumption can be retrieved from the utility maximization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp; \ u(x,y) \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; \ p_x x + p_y y = p_y \frac{L}{z_y} \\
\\
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp; \ u(x,y) \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; \ \frac{p_x}{p_y} x + y = \frac{L}{z_y} \implies \\
\max_{y} &amp;amp; \ u\left(\frac{\frac{L}{z_y} - y}{\frac{p_x}{p_y}}, y\right) \\
u^\prime_x \frac{1}{\frac{p_x}{p_y}} = u^\prime_y \implies \\
\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y} = \frac{p_x}{p_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if $u(x,y) = x^{0.4}y^{0.6}$ with $L=100,\ z_x = 10, z_y = 2$
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp; \ x^{0.4}y^{0.6} \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; \ \frac{p_x}{p_y} x + y = 50 \\
\\
y = 30
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, for this specific utility function, the optimal consumption of yogurts is independent of the price ratio.
In general, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the supply of exports is $y^\text{prod.} - y^\text{cons.} = 50 - 30 = 20$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demand-of-imports&#34;&gt;Demand of imports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand of imports (of yogurts) comes from Foreign.
If we assume they specialize in xboxes, then they produce $\frac{L^\star}{z_x^\star} = 10$ xboxes.
Their budget constraint is $p_x x + p_y y = p_x^\star \frac{L^\star}{z_x^\star} p_x = 10 p_x$.
With preferences represented by $u = x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$, the demand of yogurts is given by:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp; \ x^{0.5}y^{0.5} \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; \ p_x x + p_y y = 10 p_x  equiv \frac{p_x}{p_y} x + y = 10 \frac{p_x}{p_y} \\
\max_{y} &amp;amp; \ \left(\frac{10 \frac{p_x}{p_y} - y}{\frac{p_x}{p_y}}\right)^{0.5} y^{0.5} \\
y = 5 \frac{p_x}{p_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the demand of yogurts is $5 \frac{p_x}{p_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equilibrium&#34;&gt;Equilibrium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equilibrium is given by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.
In our example: $20 = 5 \frac{p_x}{p_y} \implies \frac{p_x}{p_y} = 4$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;changes-in-the-international-price-and-gains-from-trade&#34;&gt;Changes in the international price and gains from trade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know already that both countries gain from trade.
However, it is likely that one country gains more than the other.
We can analyze the relative gains by analyzing what happens when the price changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our baseline example, Home exports yogurt and imports xboxes.
This means that Home gains $p_y$ whenever a yogurt is exported and pays $p_x$ whenever an xbox is imported.
Therefore, if $p_y$ increases, Home gains more.
Similarly, if $p_x$ increases, Home gains less from trade.
In general, we define the &lt;strong&gt;terms of trade&lt;/strong&gt; as the ratio between the price of the exported good divided by the price of the imported good.
For Home that exports yogurts, the terms of trade are $T = \frac{p_y}{p_x}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When does Home gain more from trade?
Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze several changes that may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;home-becomes-more-productive-in-yogurts&#34;&gt;Home becomes more productive in yogurts&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify a bit the notation, let $p \equiv \frac{p_x}{p_y}$.
This means that $z_y$ decreases.
Because of the specialization of Home in yogurts, and using the previously derived demand and supply, we will have that internal demand for yogurts solves $\frac{u^\prime_x}{u^\prime_y} = p$, remaining the same.
At the same time, the production $\frac{L}{z_y}$ increases.
Therefore, the supply curve shifts to the right, increasing.
Because the demand from Foreign has not changed, the price $p = \frac{p_x}{p_y}$ falls.
This makes Home worse off, because it exports yogurts at a lower price.
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: with the caveat that Home is producing and exporting more, so perhaps the larger exports compensate the drop in prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;home-becomes-more-populated&#34;&gt;Home becomes more populated&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to before, an increase in $L$ will translate as an increase in the supply of yogurts, because $\frac{L}{z_y}$ increases.
This will make the price of yogurts fall, making Home worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the pattern we have just seen, in general larger and more productive countries will gain &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; from trade.
To think about it, it is just as if they had been growing over time and thus eroding little by little their terms of trade.
Alternatively, one can say that it is smaller and less productive countries that gain more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equilibrium-without-full-specialization&#34;&gt;Equilibrium without full specialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ricardian model allows for the case where one (and only one) country does not fully specialize in any good.
This is, under some circumstances, a country will produce both goods, while its trading partner will specialize in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one country not to specialize, it must be the case that the international price equals the price that would prevail under autarky, so that it is indifferent.
This also means that the equilibrium price ratio must coincide with $\frac{z_x}{z_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the previous case with Home specialized in yogurts.
If the size of Home increases $L \uparrow$, then the price $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ will raise from the equilibrium 4 up to a maximum of $\frac{z_x}{z_y} = \frac{10}{2} = 5$ as $p_y$ falls due to the increase in supply.
Therefore, non-specialization can occur when one country is much larger than the other.
Also, because $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ also increases when Home becomes more productive in yogurts, non-specialization can occur when one country is much more productive than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see this in reverse.
When Home is much larger than Foreign, it can be the case that even when all Foreign workers are engaged in the production of the good they export (xboxes) their production is not enough to satisfy the demand of Home.
In this case, Home will produce some of the good it imports (xboxes) and export the other (yogurts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $L=1000$ instead of 100 as before, while keeping $z_x = 10$ and $z_y = 2$.
With the utility we had before, the supply yogurts for export is $\frac{L}{z_y} - 30 = 990$ under full specialization.
With a demand from Foreign equal to $5 \frac{p_x}{p_y}$, the equilibrium price would be $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = 198$.
Clearly, the &amp;ldquo;equilibrium&amp;rdquo; price is above the autarky price, and Home would prefer not to trade at this price level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Home will produce both goods and trade at the &lt;strong&gt;least&lt;/strong&gt; favorable price level: $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y} = 5$.
At this price point, Foreign demand of yogurts is $5 \frac{p_x}{p_y} = 25$.
For the 25 yogurts, Home will receive 5 xboxes.
At this price ratio, Home will consume:
\begin{align}
max_{x,y} &amp;amp; u(x,y) = x^{0.4}y^{0.6} \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; 1000 = 10 x + 2 y \\
\\
x = 40, y = 300
\end{align}
Thus, Home will produce 325 yogurts (300 for consumption and 25 for the export market) and 35 xboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Home will remain in the autarky schedule, thus not benefiting from trade.
However, Foreign will still gain from trade because it has access to a price ratio of $5$ when the opportunity cost they have is 3.33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Exercises 1, 2 and 3 provide an alternative way to solve the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home has 1200 units of labor available. It can produce two goods, apples and bananas. The unit labor requirement in apple production is 3, while in banana production it is 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot Home&amp;rsquo;s PPF (bananas on x-axis)
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_ex_4_1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ex_4_1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the opportunity cost of apples in terms of bananas?
The opportunity cost of appes in terms of bananas can be computed as $\frac{z_a}{z_b} = \frac{3 \frac{\text{workers}}{\text{apple}}}{2 \frac{\text{workers}}{\text{banana}}} = \frac{3}{2} \frac{\text{banana}}{\text{apple}}$.
This reflects that producing 1 apple requires 3 workers.
To increase 1 apple&amp;rsquo;s production by 1, we need 3 additional workers.
With 3 workers one can harves $\frac{3}{2}$ bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of trade, what would be the price of apples in terms of bananas? Why?
With labour mobility, the wage has to be the same in both sectors.
Moreover, with perfect competition, wages are the marginal productivity.
Hence: $w_a = p_a \frac{1}{3}$ and $w_b = p_b \frac{1}{2}$.
Setting $w = w_a = w_b$ gives us $\frac{p_a}{p_b} = \frac{3}{2}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now also another country, Foreign,
with a labor force of 800. Foreign’s unit labor requirement in apple production
is 5, while in banana production it is 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph Foreign’s production possibility frontier.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construct the world relative supply curve.
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: this technique was not explained in the course.
The autarky price of apples in terms of bananas in Foreign is $\frac{p_a}{p_b} = \frac{5}{1} = 5$.
Hence, Home will specialize in apples and Foreign in bananas.
The relative supply curve indicates the total supply of apples divided by the total supply of bananas, considering both countries.
Suppose the international price level is 1.5.
At this price level, Home is indifferent between trading or not, while Foreign specializes in bananas.
The minimum number of apples that Home can produce is 0, and the maximum is $\frac{L}{z_a} = \frac{1200}{3} = 400$.
With Foreign specializing in bananas, it will produce 0 apples and 800 bananas.
Hence, at price level $\frac{3}{2}$ the world relative supply of apples takes values between $\frac{0}{800}$ and $\frac{400}{800}$.
For prices between $\frac{3}{2}$ and $5$, each country specializes in one good: Home produces 400 apples and 0 bananas, while Foreign produces 0 apples and 800 bananas.
Hence, the world relative supply is $\frac{400}{800} = \frac{1}{2}$ for $1.5 \leq \frac{p_a}{p_b} \leq 5$.
At price $5$ and above, both countries specialize in apples.
Hence, the relative supply of apples goes to infinity.
Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_ex_4_3.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ex_4_3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the world relative demand for apples is $\frac{D^A}{D^B} = \frac{p_b}{p_a}$, find the equilibrium price and plot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $\frac{p_a}{p_b} = 2$, the relative demand is 2, which is a point on the relative supply schedule, revealing the equilibrium.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo_ex_4_4.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ex_4_4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home is characterized by $L = 50, z_x = 4, z_y = 1$, where $z_{i}$ indicates number of workers required to produce one unit. Consumer preferences are given by $u(x,y) = \log(x) + y$ (log-linear preferences, non-homothetic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the autarky wage?
Because labor is mobile across sectors, the wage must be equal in both.
A firm maximizes profits $\pi_x = p_x x - w_x z_x x \implies w_z = w = \frac{p_x}{z_x}$.
Similarly, $w_y = w = \frac{p_y}{z_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the autarky price ratio?
From the condition above, $w = \frac{p_x}{z_x} = \frac{p_y}{z_y} \implies \frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{z_x}{z_y} = 4$.
We will come back to this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the autarky production and consumption?
In autarky, production equals consumption all while maximizing utility.
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} \log(x) + y \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; 50 = 4 x + y \\
\\
x = 0.25, y = 49
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Foreign has $L^\star = 60$ workers, technology $z_x^\star = 6$ and $z_y^\star = 2$. Utility is $u(x,y) = \log(x) + \log(y)$. According to the Ricardian model, which good will Home export?
The opportunity cost of $x$ in Home is $\frac{z_x}{z_y} = 4$ and in Foreign is $\frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star} = 3$.
Hence, Home has a comparative advantage in $y$ and will export $y$ and import $x$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For which price range both countries will specialize in only one good?
As long as $3 &amp;lt; \frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;lt; 4$, both countries will specialize in only one good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine the equilibrium relative price and the exports and imports.
Because Home exports $y$, we construct the international supply of $y$ as a function of $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$
Assuming a full specialization, Home will produce $\frac{L}{z_y} = 50$ units of $y$.
The internal demand is:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} u= &amp;amp; \log(x) + y \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; 50 p_y = p_x x + p_y y \implies 50 = \frac{p_x}{p_y} + y \\
\\
\max_{y} &amp;amp; \log\left(\frac{50-y}{p_x}\right) + y \\
y &amp;amp;= 49
\end{align}
Hence, the international supply of $y$ is 1 unit, regardless of prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume that foreign specializes in $x$, producing $\frac{L^\star}{z_x^\star} = 10$ units of $x$.
The demand function for $y$ from Foreign comes from:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} u &amp;amp;= \log(x) + \log(y) \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp;  10 p_x = p_x x + p_y y \implies 10 \frac{p_x}{p_y} = x \frac{p_x}{p_y} + y \\
\\
\max_{y} &amp;amp; \log\left(\frac{10\frac{p_x}{p_y}-y}{\frac{p_x}{p_y}}\right) + \log(y) \\
y &amp;amp;= 5\frac{p_x}{p_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the international demand for $y$ is $5\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ and the equilibrium price is $1 = 5 \frac{p_x}{p_y} \implies \frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{1}{5}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a price cannot be an international equilibrium because Foreign, which has a comparative advantage in $x$, displays an opportunity cost for that good equal to 3.
Consequently, Foreign will produce both $x$ and $y$ while Home will specialize in $y$, with an international price $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = 3$.
Home has a demand of $y$ equal to 49 (independent of the price).
Because Home specializes, all the 50 workers are employed in $y$ production, generating $\frac{L}{z_y} = 50$ units of $y$.
Hence, Home will export 1 unit of $y$.
At the ongoing price $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = 3$, Home will exchange this 1 unit of $y$ for 0.33 units of $x$, thus Home is better off than under autarky.
Meanwhile, Foreign consume 15 units of $y$ ($5 \frac{p_x}{p_y} = 15$), of which 14 are locally produced requiring 28 workers. The remaining 32 are employed in the $x$ sector, generating 5.33 units.
Hence, total consumption of $x$ in Foreign is $5.33-0.33=5$ units.
We can check that this coincides with the autarky consumption levels in Foreign:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} u &amp;amp;= \log(x) + \log(y) \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; 60 = 6x + 2y \\
\\
\max_{x} &amp;amp; \log(x) + \log\left(\frac{60-6x}{2}\right) \\
x &amp;amp;= 5, y = 15
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: in this exercise, the equilibrium price of $0.2$ mostly came from the fact that Home had a very large demand for $y$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Empirics around Ricardo</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/ricardo-empirics/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ricardian model of international trade is simple and provides a clear prediction about the pattern of trade between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countries should specialize in the good in which they have a comparative advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With free trade, a country that exports a good does so at a (relative) price level higher than under autarky.
Otherwise, it would not export it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we have two countries with:
\begin{equation}
\frac{z_x}{z_y} &amp;gt; \frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star}
\end{equation}
Then the opportunity cost of producing good $x$ is higher at Home than in Foreign.
Consequently, Home should specialize in good $y$, Foreign in good $x$ and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we test the specialization patterns using data?
The takeaway of the Ricardian model &amp;ldquo;a country will specialize (and export) the goods for which it has a relative  &lt;strong&gt;high productivity&lt;/strong&gt;, and import the goods for which it has a relative &lt;strong&gt;low productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;
Notice the change from opportunity cost and labor requirements to productivity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had data on productivity for all goods and production (or trade data), the exercise would be simple: just correlate the two.
The main problem with this approach is that the data we have does not provide all we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices: yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who produces what and quantities: yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unitary labor costs (or labor requirements) for the produced good: maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that we &lt;strong&gt;do not observe&lt;/strong&gt; the productivity (or labor costs, or labor requirements) of the goods that &lt;strong&gt;are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; produced&lt;/strong&gt;.
“The difference in labor requirements cannot be observed, since imported goods will almost never be produced in the importing country.” (Deardorff, 1984)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;costinot-and-donaldson-2012&#34;&gt;Costinot and Donaldson (2012)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costinot and Donaldson (2012) proposed to use the agricultural sector because the productivity of a given crop under different circumstances is very well studied.
Indeed, GAEZ (Global Agro-Ecological Zones) project by the FAO predicts the productivity of land for the entire planet and for several crops.
With these data, we can very easily get a sense of how many kg of tomaotes can be produced per hectare in a given region.
To do this, the GAEZ relates soil characteristics, elevation, water availability, insolation, temperatures, etc. to the growing cycle of each plant using agricultural models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/GAEZ_wheat.png&#34; alt=&#34;wheat&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/GAEZ_banana.png&#34; alt=&#34;banana&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose France has 10 fields $f$ on which three crops can be grown: wheat, bananas and grapes.
The productivity of each crop in each field is known thanks to GAEZ.
The problem then boils down to selecting the crops that yield the largest value in each field.
It is important to note here that the yield value depends both on the prices and the productivity of each field in each crop.
A simple GDP maximization problem can be written as:
\begin{align}
\max_{K^i_{f=j}} &amp;amp; \sum_{f=1}^{10} \sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i K^i_{f=j} y_{f=j}^i \\
\text{s.t} &amp;amp; \sum_{i=1}^{3} K^i_{f=j} = 1, \forall f=1, \dots, 10 \\
&amp;amp; K^i_{f=j} \in \{0,1\}, \forall f=1, \dots, 10, \forall i=1, \dots, 3
\end{align}
where $p_i$ is the price of crop $i$, $y_{f=j}^i$ is the productivity of crop $i$ in field $f$ and $K^i_{f=j}$ indicates whether crop $i$ produced in field $f$ or not.
The restrictions simply state obvious constraints:
$\sum_{i=1}^{3} K^i_{f=j} = 1$ indicates that a field must be fully used, while $K^i_{f=j} \in \{0,1\}$ indicates that a field can only produce one crop, so each field has to be used with one and only one crop.
Without entering into the details, this is a linear progamming problem that can be solved using the simplex method.
But a more intuitive way to solve this problem is to sort the crops by the yield value (productivity time price) in each field and then select the crops with the highest value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;detour&#34;&gt;Detour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we go back to Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model, we can show that what we just described corresponds to the production decision, even though we are not limited to producing only one unit of a good.
Assume that we are given prices, then a country will specialize as follows:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp; p_x x + p_y y \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; z_x x + z_y y = L \\
&amp;amp; x, y \geq 0 \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to the above problem is: $\{x = \frac{L}{z_x}, y = 0\} \ \text{if}\ \frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;gt; \frac{z_x}{z_y}$ and $\{x = 0, y = \frac{L}{z_y} \} \ \text{if}\ \frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;lt; \frac{z_x}{z_y}$.
This is, when the relative price of $x$ is higher than the relative productivity of $x$, then the country will specialize in $x$ and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ricardo-empirics-maximization.webp&#34; alt=&#34;graphical_maximization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the method we described, Costinot and Donaldson can compute the crop that maximizes yields for each field in each country.
Then, by aggregating predicted production (using the GAEZ data) over all the fields in a country, they can compute the production of each crop in each country.
Finally, they compare the prediction based on comparative advantage from Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model to the actual production data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/costinot_donaldson_t1.png&#34; alt=&#34;restuls&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They find a positive correlation between the predicted production (in logaithms) and the actual production (in logarithms).
The coefficient is not 1 (as it should if the model were perfect) because the only land uses they considered are for farming, yet land is also used for other purposes: urban areas, industrrial areas, infastructure, etc.
Another problem is that the data from GAEZ divides the world in squares of approximilately 10km by 10km.
The best crop can vary within that area, so the model might not be able to capture that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, the model does a good job at predicting the production of each country, but it is not perfect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have asked a simple question: How do output levels predicted by Ricardo’s theory compare to those that are observed in the data? 
Despite all of the  real-world considerations from which Ricardo’s
theory abstracts, we find that a regression of log output on log predicted output has a (precisely estimated) slope of 0.21. 
Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage, is not just mathematically correct and nontrivial; it also has significant explanatory power in the data, at least within the scope of our analysis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bernhofen-and-brown-2004&#34;&gt;Bernhofen and Brown (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costinot and Donaldson (2012) show that, given prices, producitivities are quite good at predicting patterns of specialization.
This is, we have empirically validated that countries tend to specialize in the good that they are more productive in (lower unitary requirements).
However, the Ricardian model is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; about trade.
The main prediction in that sense is that free trade causes a country to &lt;em&gt;export&lt;/em&gt; the good in which it has a comparative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending this result, a natural corollary arises: because a country tends to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, it means it can produce this good more cheaply than other countries.
Put it in other terms: to sell that good, the international price must be higher than the domestic opportunity cost.
Since prices in autarky reflect the domestic opportunity cost, it follows that the international price must be higher than the autarky price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, in general, one does not observe the same country in autarky and under free trade.
Bernofen and Brown (2004) lookd at Japan, which opened itself to trade in 1853.
From 1639, Japan forbid all contact with outsiders, isolating itself from international markets and operating under autarky.
In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry, an American naval officer, led a fleet of four warships to Japan in an attempt to force the country to open its ports to foreign trade. Japan had been under a strict policy of isolation for over 200 years, known as &amp;ldquo;sakoku,&amp;rdquo; which had prevented any contact with outsiders.
By 1860, after several military interventions and treaties, Japan had opened its ports to foreign trade and began to modernize its economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the results from a comparison of price increases to pre-1853 trade levels:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/bernhofen_brown_f4.png&#34; alt=&#34;bernhofen_brown_f4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The prices of major exports such as products of the silk industry (silk and silkworm eggs) and minor exports such as copper manufactures, sake, and vegetable wax all increased; in some cases they almost doubled. 
The relative price of key imports such as sugar, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and iron products displayed substantial declines.
The increase in the price of rice and legumes may reflect poor weather conditions, and the increase in the price of cotton may stem from the disruption of cotton markets in the wake of the American Civil War.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This corroborates the Ricardian model: Japan specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, and because the international price is higher than the autarky price, once trade begins the price of the good increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second test the authors implement is based on the same idea.
Let&amp;rsquo;s work it out with an example:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Suppose that, under autarky with autarky prices ($p_x = 4, p_y = 8$), the
country decides to consume (and produce!) at the levels $x = 50, y = 25$.
Assume that international prices, one the country opens up to trade, are $p_x = 5, p_y = 5$.
Because the country has a comparative advantage in $x$, it will export $x$ and import $y$.
At this new price level, consumption is $x = 50, y = 50$, with the country using all its labor force to produce $x$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trade begins, the good we export becomes more expensive and the imported good cheaper.
It is possible to show that the value of net exports (exports minus imports) evaluated &lt;em&gt;at autarky prices&lt;/em&gt; is negative.
In our example, the net export of $x$ is $50 - 0 = 50$ and the net export of $y$ is $0 - 50 = -50$.
Thus, the value of net exports is $50 \times 4 + (-50) \times 8 = -200 &amp;lt; 0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can show this more generally.
When the economy opens up to international trade, in the Ricardian model trade is balanced, meaning that the value of exports equals the value of imports.
Suppose that $\frac{p_x^f}{p_y^f} &amp;gt; \frac{p_x^a}{p_y^a}$, so that $x$ is the good with comparative advantage.
Using $x$ and $y$ for production and $c_x$ and $c_y$ for consumption, we have:
$p_x^{f} (x^f-c_x^f) = p_y^{f} (c_y^f-y^f)$, where $x^f - c_x^f &amp;gt; 0$ because the country exports $x$ and  $c_y^f - y^f$ &amp;gt; 0, because the country imports $y$.
The superscript $f$ denotes the free trade equilibrium.
From here:
\begin{align}
p_x^{f} (x^f-c_x^f) &amp;amp;= p_y^{f} (c_y^f-y^f) \implies \\
\frac{p_x^{f}}{p_y^f} (x^f-c_x^f) = (c_y^f-y^f) \implies \\
\frac{p_x^{f}}{p_y^f} (x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f) &amp;amp;= 0 \\
\frac{p_x^{f}}{p_y^f} (x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f) &amp;amp;&amp;lt; \frac{p_x^a}{p_y^a}(x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f) \implies \\
\frac{p_x^a}{p_y^a}(x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f) &amp;lt; 0
\end{align}
Where $\frac{p_x^{f}}{p_y^f} (x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f) &amp;lt; \frac{p_x^a}{p_y^a}(x^f-c_x^f) - (c_y^f-y^f)$ is true because $\frac{p_x^{f}}{p_y^f} &amp;gt; \frac{p_x^a}{p_y^a}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup in Bernhofen and Brown is a bit more complex because they have more goods and trade may not be balanced.
In any case, the general conclusion holds: if we evaluate net exports at autarky prices, we should observe a negative value.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/bernhofen_brown_t2.png&#34; alt=&#34;t2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the result, confirming again the validity of the Ricardian trade model.
In this case, they have shown that trade patterns are in accordance with the theoretical predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, I am assuming that $u(x,y) = x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$ and $L=100$.
Moreover, in general we do not have prices but relative prices.
In any case, the relative price ratio in autarky $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to labor requirements $z_x = 1,\ z_y = 2$, for instance.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Heckscher-Ohlin model</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/heckscher-ohlin/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/heckscher-ohlin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo&amp;rsquo;s model of international trade is based on the idea of &lt;strong&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/strong&gt; and predicts that countries gain from trade because they have &lt;strong&gt;different productivities&lt;/strong&gt;.
Yet, the reason for productivity differentials comes from different technology: $z_x,z_y$ are different from $z_x^\star,z_y^\star$ (actually, what matters is $\frac{z_x}{z_y} \neq \frac{z_x^\star}{z_y^\star}$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, countries also have different endowements so that, even if they have the same technology, they may have different productivities because they will use the inputs in different proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a country endowed with plenty of capital and little labor has a comparative advantage in goods that require lots of capital, but little labor — such as grains.
If capital abounds, its price is low.
Also, because capital is the main production factor in capital intesive industries, the price of capital-intensive goods will be low.
Labor-intensive goods, on the other hand, are very expensive to produce since labor is scarce and its price is high. Therefore, the country is better off importing those goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to the Hecskcher-Ohlin model, the comparative advantage is due to the fact that nations have various factors of production with varying endowments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;factor-intensities-and-an-example&#34;&gt;Factor intensities, and an example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor intensity measures the relationship between capital and labor in the production of a good.
This is, the capital intensity is the ratio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
\frac{K}{L}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see later how to compute it.
A key element of the Heckscher-Ohlin model is that one sector is capital intensive while the other is labor intensive.
An important remark is that, in the model, the capital intensive industry is capital intensive &lt;em&gt;for each level of production&lt;/em&gt;.
This is, there are no reversals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have an industry producing one good with capital and labor.
We assume that this good is capital intensive, which means that the capital-labor ratio used in this industry is large.
Let $Y = K^{0.8}L^{0.2}$ be the production function of this good.
We can compute, for instance, how much dost it cost to produce 100 units of this good.
\begin{align}
\min_{L,K} &amp;amp; w L + r K \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; Y = K^{0.8}L^{0.2} = 100
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
ToRadicals@
 RootReduce@
  MinValue[{w L + r K, 100 == K^(0.8) L^(0.2), r &gt; 0, w &gt; 0}, {K, L}, 
   Reals]

  Solution: 125 (-2)^(2/5) r^(4/5) w^(1/5)
  Note that (-2)^(2/5) = 4^(1/5)
!--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum cost (difficult to solve) is: $125 \times 4^\frac{1}{5}  w^{1/5} r^\frac{4}{5}$.
Suppose we had prices $w=a$ and $r=b$ with $a&amp;gt;b$ because labor is scarce.
The cost of producing is $125 \times 4^\frac{1}{5} a^\frac{1}{5} b^{4/5}$.
Would the cost decrease if the the prices were reversed, $w=b$ and $r=a$?
The answer is no:
\begin{align}
125 \times 4^\frac{1}{5} b^\frac{1}{5} a^{4/5} &amp;amp;&amp;lt; 125 \times 4^\frac{1}{5} a^\frac{1}{5} b^{4/5} \\
b^\frac{1}{5} a^{4/5} &amp;amp; &amp;lt;  a^\frac{1}{5} b^{4/5} \\
a^\frac{3}{5} &amp;amp; &amp;lt; b^\frac{3}{5} \\
a &amp;lt; b
\end{align}
Which is a contradiction because we assumed $a &amp;gt; b$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hints to the general idea that, because the industry is capital intensive, it benefits from having aboundant capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-goods-2-factors-2-countries&#34;&gt;2 Goods, 2 Factors, 2 Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the model focusing on trade, which necessitates two countries, we begin the analysis with one country only to understand how production decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before, we will consider that production functions (this is, technology) are the same across countries.
However, each sector has a specific production function involving two factors of production: capital and labor.
The total labor force in the country is $L$ and the total amount of capital is $K$.
The economy produces two goods, as before: xboxes and yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because each sector uses capital and labor for production, let $L_x$ and $L_y$ be the amount of labor used in the production of xboxes and yogurt, respectively.
Similarlly, let $K_x$ and $K_y$ be the amount of capital used in the production of xboxes and yogurt, respectively.
Mirroring the Ricardian model, production factors are &lt;strong&gt;perfectly&lt;/strong&gt; mobile across sectors, but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; across countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production functions are:
\begin{align}
Q_x &amp;amp;= \mathcal{X}(K_x, L_x) \\
Q_y &amp;amp;= \mathcal{Y}(K_y, L_y)
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some standard assumptions apply to $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production is increasing in both factors of production.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{\partial \mathcal{X}}{\partial j_x} &amp;gt; 0, j \in {K, L}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}}{\partial j_y} &amp;gt; 0, j \in {K, L}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The marginal product of each factor is decreasing in the amount of that factor used.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{X}}{\partial j_x^2} &amp;lt; 0, j \in {K, L}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{Y}}{\partial j_y^2} &amp;lt; 0, j \in {K, L}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The production functions are &lt;strong&gt;homogenous of degree one&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathcal{X}(tK_x, tL_x) = t\mathcal{X}(K_x, L_x)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathcal{Y}(tK_y, tL_y) = t\mathcal{Y}(K_y, L_y)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More on that on &lt;a href=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/mathematical_appendix/homogenous_functions/&#34;&gt;Homogenous Functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have preferences (as in Ricardo) over the consumption of both goods.
Moreover, preferences are also the same in both countries, so this cannot drive trade.
With preferences being represented by
\begin{align}
U(Q_x, Q_y)
\end{align}
we impose utility to be increasing in both arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{\partial U}{\partial Q_j} &amp;gt; 0, j \in {x, y}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autarky&#34;&gt;Autarky&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In autarky, consumption equals production because there is no trade.
Let&amp;rsquo;s find out how the country determines the amout of xboxes and yogurt to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;production-and-factor-allocation&#34;&gt;Production and Factor Allocation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, production.
The country has a total amount of capital $K$ and a total amount of labor $L$, and we assume perfect competition.
A representative firm in the xbox sector maximizes profits:
\begin{align}
\max_{K_x, L_x} \pi_x &amp;amp;= P_x Q_x - w_x L_x - r_x K_x \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; Q_x =  \mathcal{X}(K_x, L_x)
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximization problem can be solved using by substituting $Q_x =  \mathcal{X}(K_x, L_x)$ into the objective function and maximizing with respect to $K_x$ and $L_x$.
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K_x} &amp;amp;= P_x \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}}{\partial K_x} - r_x  = 0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L_x} &amp;amp;= P_x \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}}{\partial L_x} - w_x  = 0 \\
\\
p_x \frac{d \mathcal{X}}{d K_x} &amp;amp;= r_x \\
p_y \frac{d \mathcal{X}}{d L_x} &amp;amp;= w_x
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Question: how can we be sure that these equations have a solution?&lt;/summary&gt;
  Answer: because we have decreasing marginal returns. 
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we compute the wage-rental ratio for the xbox sector, we get an optimality condition:
\begin{align}
\frac{w}{r} &amp;amp;= \frac{\mathcal{X}_L}{\mathcal{X}_K} = \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the term $MPL_x$ is the marginal product of labor in the xbox sector and $MPK_x$ is the marginal product of capital in the xbox sector and the ratio $\frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$ is called the &lt;strong&gt;marginal rate of technical substitution&lt;/strong&gt;.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is the rate at which the country can substitute capital for labor in the xbox sector so that the level of output remains constant.
We can easily check this by differentiating the production function:
$0 = \mathcal{X}_K \mathrm{d}K_x + \mathcal{X}_L \mathrm{d}L_x \implies \frac{\mathcal{d}K_x}{\mathcal{d}L_x} = -\frac{\mathcal{X}_L}{\mathcal{X}_K} = \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see why it represents optimality, suppose $\frac{w_x}{r_x} &amp;lt; \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$.
If we use one less unit of capital (K) and substitute it with labor (L) according to the MRTS, we can maintain the same level of output.
The cost saving from using one less unit of labor is $w_x$.
If we decrease labor by one unit, we must increase capital by $\frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$ units.
This costs $r_x \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$.
Since $w_x &amp;lt; r_x \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$, we can save more by substituting capital with labor.
So any situtation where $\frac{w_x}{r_x} \neq \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$ is not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically, when $\frac{w_x}{r_x}$ increases, the labor to capital ratio decreases.
Intuitively, when $\frac{w_x}{r_x}$ increases, hiring workers becomes more expensive relative to hiring capital.
Consequently, firms will hire less labor and more capital.
By decreasing the number of workers $MPL_x$ increases, and by having more capital $MPK_x$ decreases.
Therefore, $\frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x}$ increases, too.
But $\frac{L}{K}$ rises!

  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ho_labor_capital.webp&#34; alt=&#34;rental-wage-ratio&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a Cobb-Douglas production function for xboxes such as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X} = K_x^\xi L_x^{1-\xi},\quad \xi \in (0,1)
\end{equation}
$\xi$ is the Greek letter xi, for xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marginal products of labor and capital are:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{X}_L &amp;amp;= (1-\xi) K_x^\xi L_x^{-\xi} \\
\mathcal{X}_K &amp;amp;= \xi K_x^{\xi-1} L_x^{1-\xi}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, profit maximization implies:
\begin{align}
\frac{w_x}{r_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{\mathcal{X}_L}{\mathcal{X}_K} = \frac{(1-\xi) K_x^\xi L_x^{-\xi}}{\xi K_x^{\xi-1} L_x^{1-\xi}} = \frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \frac{K_x}{L_x}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we showed before, when $\frac{w_x}{r_x}$ increases, the labor to capital ratio decreases.
This is because $\frac{w_x}{r_x}$ increases, hiring workers becomes more expensive relative to hiring capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have two sectors, we can write the same equation for the yogurt sector:
\begin{align}
w_y &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}}{\partial L_y} \\
r_y &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}}{\partial K_y} \\
\\
\frac{w_y}{r_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{\mathcal{Y}_L}{\mathcal{Y}_K} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPK_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, workers and capital can move freely between the two sectors.
If the wage in the xbox sector were higher than the wage in the yogurt sector, workers would move from the yogurt sector to the xbox sector.
Consequently, no yogurt would be produced.
In general, this is sub-optimal because typically one imposes the Inada conditions in the utility function.
The Inada conditions indicate that marginal utilities are infinite when consumption of a good is zero, so that utility can be massively increased by moving from zero to some positive consumption.
Since in autarky consumption must be equal to production, this means that if consumers want to always consume some good, production of that good must be positive.
In general, to be able to produce something both production factors must be present, meaning that wages must be the same in both sectors so that workers work in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same reasoning, we conclude that rental rates must be equal in both sectors because capital can move freely between the two sectors.
Hence $w_x = w_y = w$ and $r_x = r_y = r$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that $\frac{w_x}{r_x} = \frac{w_y}{r_y}$ and therefore the marginal rates of technical substitution are equal in both sectors.
\begin{align}
\frac{w_x}{r_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{w_y}{r_y} \implies \\
\frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPL_y}{MPK_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we will see in more detail when talking about &lt;a href=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/&#34;&gt;the Standard Trade Model&lt;/a&gt;, this condition already implies that we can write labor in one sector as a function of capital in that same sector (or write capital as a function of labor).
Moving from here to a PPF is a simple step, but often mathematically involved and impossible to solve analytically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;factor-intensity&#34;&gt;Factor intensity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to our example where $\mathcal{X} = K_x^\xi L_x^{1-\xi}$, which lead to $\frac{w_x}{r_x} = \frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \frac{K_x}{L_x}$.
Assume that yogurts also have a Cobb-Douglas production function, but exponent, $\mathcal{Y} = K_y^\upsilon L_y^{1-\upsilon}$, where $\upsilon$ is the Greek letter &amp;ldquo;upsilon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the yogurt sector, we will have
\begin{align}
\frac{w_y}{r_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{K_y}{L_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $\frac{w_x}{r_x} = \frac{w_y}{r_y}$, we thus have
\begin{align}
\frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \frac{K_x}{L_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{K_y}{L_y} \implies
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that $\xi &amp;gt; \upsilon$, meaning the capital is more producive in the xbox sector than in the yogurt sector.
How does it affect the ratio of capital to labor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \frac{K_x}{L_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{K_y}{L_y} \implies \\
\frac{\frac{K_x}{L_x}}{\frac{K_y}{L_y}} &amp;amp;= \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{\xi}{1-\xi} \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because $\xi &amp;gt; \upsilon$, the right-hand side is larger than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Proof&lt;/summary&gt;
  Suppose $\xi &gt; \upsilon$.
  We will show that, assuming $\frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{\xi}{1-\xi} &lt; 1$, leads to a contradiction.
  \begin{align}
    \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{\xi}{1-\xi} &amp;&lt; 1 \implies \text{because}\ \xi \in (0,1) \\\\
    \frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} &amp;&lt; \frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \implies \\\\
    (1-\upsilon)\xi &amp;&lt; (1-\xi)\upsilon \implies \\\\
    \xi - \upsilon\xi &amp;&lt; \upsilon - \upsilon\xi \implies \\\\
    \xi &amp;&lt; \upsilon
  \end{align}
  This is a contradiction, so we must have $\frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon} \frac{\xi}{1-\xi} &gt; 1$.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that capital intensity is higher in the xbox sector than in the yogurt sector.
This is $\frac{K_x}{L_x} &amp;gt; \frac{K_y}{L_y}$.
Note that, in the plot, we have $\frac{L}{K}$.
Because the yogurt sector is more labor intense, its curve lies to the right of the xbox sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ho_capital_intensity.webp&#34; alt=&#34;intensity&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we know that the total amount of labor and capital must be divided between the two industries.
\begin{align}
L_x + L_y &amp;amp;= L \\
K_x + K_y &amp;amp;= K
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the conutry-wide labor-capital ratio is:
\begin{align}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= \frac{L_x + L_y}{K} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y} \frac{K_y}{K} \\
\end{align}
This expression indicates that, at the country level, the capital-labor ratio is a weighted average of the capital-labor ratios in the two sectors.
The weights are the shares of capital in each sector.
Here the term $\frac{L}{K}$ is the relative supply of labour, while the term $\frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y} \frac{K_y}{K}$ is the relative demand.
Note that, supply is given and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ho_capital_intensity_weighted.webp&#34; alt=&#34;intensity_economy&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, given the relative wage-to-rental-rate ratio, the capital-labor ratio in each sector, and the total amount of labor and capital, we can determine the country-wide capital-labor ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stolper-samuelson-theorem&#34;&gt;The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stolper-Samuelson theorem studies the effect of a &lt;strong&gt;change in the relative price of a good&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;relative remuneration of the two factors of production&lt;/strong&gt; and the real remuneration of each factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theorem states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the relative price of the good produced by the labor-intensive sector increases, then the relative wage increases ($\frac{w}{r} \uparrow$), the real wage increases and the real rental rate decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, alternatively, if the relative price of the good produced by the capital-intensive sector increases, then the relative wage decreases ($\frac{w}{r}  \downarrow$), the real wage decreases and the real rental rate increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem indicates that, when prices change, there are winners and losers.
Therefore, when a country opens up to trade, we know that the good it exports will increase in price, and the good it imports will decrease in price.
Consequently, and differently from the Ricardian model, under Hecksher-Ohlin, opposition to trade from the importing sector is (partily) rational.
Nevertheless, the gains from trade as suffficiently large to outweigh the losses, allowing the winners to fully compensate the losers and still be better off.
Hence, trade remains Pareto-improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s prove the Stolepr-Samuelson theorem.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the first-order conditions in both sectors:
\begin{align}
w_x &amp;amp;= p_x PML_x \\
w_y &amp;amp;= p_y PML_y \\
r_x &amp;amp;= p_x PMP_x \\
r_y &amp;amp;= p_y PMP_y
\end{align}
and recalling that to have production in both sectors we must have $w_x = w_y$ and $r_x = r_y$, then we can also re-arrange the expressions to get:
\begin{align}
w &amp;amp;= p_x MPL_x = p_y MPL_y \implies \frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} \\
r &amp;amp;= p_x MPK_x = p_y MPK_y \implies \frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{MPK_y}{MPK_x}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are in a good position to analyze what happens when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ changes.
Assume that $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, so xboxes become more expensive relative to yogurt.
Then, because $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}$, it must be that $\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}$ increases.
If $MPL_y$ increases, this indicates that $L_y$ has decreased.
Alternatively, it can also be the case that $PML_x$ decreases, meaning that $L_x$ has increased.
So, the first thing we notice is that, when the price of xboxes increases, labor moves from the yogurt sector to the xbox sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the second equation we can see the effects on capital.
Indeed, when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, then $\frac{MPK_y}{MPK_x}$ increases.
As before, this can be due to $MPK_y$ increasing, which means that $K_y$ has decreased, or $MPK_x$ decreasing, which means that $K_x$ has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is clear that when the price of xboxes increases, capital and labor move from the yogurt sector to the xbox sector.
Therefore, the production of xboxes increases and the production of yogurt decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect the wage-to-rental-rate ratio?
We know that the economy-wide labor-capital ratio follows:
\begin{align}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= \frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y}\frac{K_y}{K}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, capital moves to the xbox sector ($K_x \uparrow$) which increases the &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; of the xbox sector in the labor demand.
Moreover, xbox production is capital-intensive, meaning that for any wage-to-rental-rate ratio, $\frac{L_x}{K_x} &amp;lt; \frac{L_y}{K_y}$.
Then, the economy-wide labor-capital ratio $\frac{L}{K}$ becomes closer to the xbox sector&amp;rsquo;s labor-capital ratio $\frac{L_x}{K_x}$.
As a consequence, $\frac{w}{r}$ falls for all levels $\frac{L}{K}$.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ho_capital_intensity_equilibrium_2.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ho_capital_intensity_equilibrium_2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, forms want to produce more xboxes because they are more profitable.
To do so, capital and labor in the xbox industry must increase.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we move one unit of capital from the yogurt sector to the xbox sector.
Because the capital intensity in the xbox sector is higher than in the yogurt sector ($\frac{K_x}{L_x} &amp;gt; \frac{K_y}{L_y}$), for each unit of capital in the xbox sector, we need less workers than those that will be freed in the yogurt sector.
So, workers are in excess supply and the wage rate must adjust downwards to clear the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, at the new equilibrium, both sectors deepened their labor-capital intensity, this is, the ratio $\frac{L}{K}$ increases, as indicated by the graph (and because $\frac{w}{r}$ is inversely related to $\frac{L}{K}$ in all sectors).
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/ho_capital_intensity_equilibrium_3.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ho_capital_intensity_equilibrium_3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if $\frac{K_x}{L_x} = 2 \implies K_x = 2 L_x$ and $\frac{K_y}{L_y} = 1 \implies K_y = 1 L_y$, then moving 10 units of capital from the yogurt sector to the xbox sector requires adding 5 workers to the xbox sector.
Yet, because we moved 10 units of capital from the yogurt sector, we have to decrease employment by 10 workers in the yogurt sector.
So, we have an excess of 5 workers that will push the wage down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;border: 2px  solid #3498db; padding: 10px; margin: 20px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h2 style=&#34;color: #3498db; margin: 0 0 10px 0;&#34;&gt;Result 1&lt;/h2&gt;
  An increase in the relative price of a good will increase the relative factor price of the factor that it uses intensively.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can study who wins and who looses from an increase in $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$.
We do so by analyzing the &lt;em&gt;real wage&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;real capital return&lt;/em&gt;, this is, $\frac{w}{p_x}$, $\frac{w}{p_y}$ and $\frac{r}{p_x}$, $\frac{r}{p_y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production factors are paid their marginal productivity:
\begin{align}
r &amp;amp;= p_x MPK_x \quad \text{and} \quad r = p_y MPK_y \\
\frac{r}{p_x} &amp;amp;= MPK_x \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{r}{p_y} = MPK_y
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had:
\begin{align}
\frac{w}{s} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x} \\
\frac{w}{s} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPL_y}{MPK_y}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because $\frac{w}{s}$ decreases, the marginal product of labor must decrease and the marginal product of capital increases.
Importantly, this happens in &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real wage expressed in terms of xboxes is $\frac{w}{p_x}$.
From the first-order conditions $w = p_x MPL_x$ we thus have $\frac{w}{p_x} = MPL_x$.
Since $MPL_x$ decreases, the real wage decreases.
The same is true if we express the real wage in terms of yogurts.
From the first-order condition $w = p_y MPL_y$ we have $\frac{w}{p_y} = MPL_y$.
Since $MPL_y$ decreases, the real wage decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token, we can see that real capital return increases in both sectors.
Starting from the first order conditions $r = p_x MPK_x$ and $r = p_y MPK_y$, we have $\frac{r}{p_x} = MPK_x$ and $\frac{r}{p_y} = MPK_y$.
So, the real capital return increases when we express it in terms of xboxes or yogurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;border: 2px  solid #3498db; padding: 10px; margin: 20px;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Winners and losers from a price change&lt;/b&gt;
  A rise in the relative price of a good will make the owner of the factor that the good uses intensively better off and make the owner of the factor of that the good does not use intensively worse of.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-1&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that $\mathcal{X} = K_x^\frac{2}{3} L_x^\frac{1}{3}$ and $\mathcal{Y} = K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^\frac{2}{3}$.
From the optimality conditions (and equality of wages and returns) we have:
\begin{align}
\frac{w}{r} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{1}{3} K_x^\frac{2}{3} L_x^\frac{-2}{3}}{\frac{2}{3} K_x^\frac{-1}{3} L_x^\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{K_x}{L_x} \\
\frac{w}{r} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{2}{3} K_x^\frac{1}{3} L_x^\frac{-1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} K_x^\frac{-2}{3} L_x^\frac{2}{3}} = 2 \frac{K_x}{L_x} \\
\end{align}
From here, we can derive the labour-capital ratios as functions of $\frac{w}{p}$:
\begin{align}
\frac{L_x}{K_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{w}{r}\right)^{-1} \\
\frac{L_y}{K_y} &amp;amp;= 2 \left(\frac{w}{r}\right)^{-1} \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, in equilibrium we must have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{K} = \frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y}\frac{K_y}{K}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substituting the labour-capital ratios from above, we get:
\begin{align}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{w}{r}\right)^{-1} \frac{K_x}{K} + 2 \left(\frac{w}{r}\right)^{-1} \frac{K_y}{K} \implies \\
\frac{w}{r} &amp;amp;= \frac{K}{L}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x}{K} + 2\frac{K_y}{K}\right)
\end{align}
Finally, because $K = K_x + K_y$
\begin{equation}
\frac{w}{r} = \frac{K}{L}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x}{K} + 2\frac{(K-K_x)}{K}\right)
\end{equation}
Therefore, when $K_x$ increases, $\frac{w}{r}$ decreases because $\frac{\partial \frac{w}{r}}{\partial K_x} = \frac{K}{L}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{K} - 2\frac{1}{K}\right) = -\frac{K}{L}\frac{1}{2} &amp;lt; 0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have the following relationship:
\begin{align}
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{2}{3}K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^\frac{-1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}K_x^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{-2}{3}} = 2 \frac{K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_x^\frac{2}{3}}{K_x^\frac{2}{3} L_y^\frac{1}{3}} \\
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{1}{3}K_y^\frac{-2}{3}L_y^\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}K_x^\frac{-1}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{3}} =  \frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x^\frac{1}{3}L_y^\frac{2}{3}}{K_y^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{3}} \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, because $K = K_x + K_y$, and $L = L_x + L_y$, we can write:
\begin{align}
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= 2 \frac{(K-K_x)^\frac{1}{3} L_x^\frac{2}{3}}{K_x^\frac{2}{3} (L - L_x)^\frac{1}{3}} \\
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x^\frac{1}{3}(L-L_x)^\frac{2}{3}}{(K-K_x)^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{3}}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = 0.75$ and that $L = 10 , K = 20$.
Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
0.75 &amp;amp;= 2 \frac{(20-K_x)^\frac{1}{3} L_x^\frac{2}{3}}{K_x^\frac{2}{3} (10 - L_x)^\frac{1}{3}} \\
0.75 &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x^\frac{1}{3}(10-L_y)^\frac{2}{3}}{(20-K_x)^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{3}} \\
\\ \\
K_x &amp;amp;= 10.8642,, L_x = 2.2917,, K_y = 9.1358,, L_y = 7.7083
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, from,
\begin{equation}
\frac{w}{r} = \frac{K}{L}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x}{K} + 2\frac{(K-K_x)}{K}\right)
\end{equation}
we can retrieve the wage-rental ratio $\frac{w}{r} = 2.37$
The real wage in terms of $x$ is $\frac{w}{p_x} = MPL_x = 0.94$, in terms of $y$ is 0.70 and the real rental rate is $\frac{r}{p_x} = 0.39$ and $\frac{r}{p_y} = 0.2976$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases to $0.8$, then:
\begin{align}
0.8 &amp;amp;= 2 \frac{(20-K_x)^\frac{1}{3} L_x^\frac{2}{3}}{K_x^\frac{2}{3} (10 - L_x)^\frac{1}{3}} \\
0.8 &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\frac{K_x^\frac{1}{3}(10-L_y)^\frac{2}{3}}{(20-K_x)^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{3}} \\
\\ \\
K_x &amp;amp;= 13.6458,, L_x = 3.493, K_y = 6.3541,, L_y = 6.506
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the wage-rental ratio decreases to $\frac{w}{r} = 1.9531$
The real wage in terms of $x$ is $\frac{w}{p_x} = MPL_x = 0.826$, in terms of $y$ is 0.661 and the real rental rate is $\frac{r}{p_x} = 0.423$ and $\frac{r}{p_y} = 0.3386$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, as predicted, when the relative price of the capital-intensive good increases, the wage-rental ratio decreases, the real wage decreases, and the real rental rate increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rybczynski-theorem&#34;&gt;The Rybczynski Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rybczynski theorem states that at constant relative goods prices, a rise in the endowment of one factor will lead to a more than proportional expansion of the output in the sector which uses that factor intensively, and an absolute decline of the output of the other good.
This is, in general, an increase in a country&amp;rsquo;s endowment of a factor will cause an increase in output of the good which uses that factor intensively, and a decrease in the output of the other good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that our country experiences a population increase.
According to the theorem, the yogurt sector (intensive in labor) will increase its production more than proportionally, and the xbox sector (intensive in capital) will decrease its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily verify this.
From
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{K} = \frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y}\frac{K_y}{K}
\end{equation}
an increase in $L$ means that the left-hand side increases in value.
Because yogurts are labor-intensive $\left(\frac{K_x}{L_x} &amp;gt; \frac{K_y}{L_y} \implies \frac{L_y}{K_y} &amp;gt; \frac{L_x}{K_x} \right)$, to increase the right-hand side of the equation we need to increase $\frac{K_y}{K}$, and thus decrease $\frac{K_x}{K}$.
Moving capital to the yogurt sector increases its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hecksher-ohlin-theorem&#34;&gt;The Hecksher-Ohlin Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose now that we finally have two countries: Home and Foreign.
Each country is endowed with labor $L, L^\star$ and capital $K, k^\star$.
There are two sectors in each country: xbox and yogurt.
Production technology is the same in both countries, this is, $x = \mathcal{X}(K, L)$ and $y = \mathcal{Y}(K, L)$.
Consumers also have the same preferences over xboxes and yogurts in both countries indicated by $u(x,y)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hecksher-Ohlin theorem states that in the long run, the country that is relatively more abundant in a factor will specialize in the production of the good that uses that factor intensively.
Let&amp;rsquo;s derive it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we suppose that Home and Foreign have exactly the same endowments.
$L = L^\star$ and $K = K^\star$.
Becuase they also have the same technology and preferences, trade does &lt;strong&gt;not occur&lt;/strong&gt;.
Their internal prices are identical, and thus the international price will also coincide with the two autarky prices.
The relative supply of labor with respect to capital at the world level is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L + L^\star}{K + K^\star}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s shift some capital from Foreign to Home, such that Home is capital abundant and Foreign labor abundant.
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;lt; \frac{L + L^\star}{K + K^\star} &amp;lt; \frac{L^\star}{K^\star}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rybczynski theorem tells us that Home will increase its production of xboxes and decrease its production of yogurts, because xboxes are capital-intensive.
With exactly the same preferences, Home will have an excess supply of xboxes (alternatively, the price of xboxes at Home will be lower than in Foreign), so it will export xboxes and import yogurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication is clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a country opens up to international trade, it will specialize in the production of the good that uses the factor that it is relatively more abundant in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, from the Stolper-Samuelson theorem we also know that capital owners will benefit from trade in Home, and workers will benefit from trade in Foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solving-the-model&#34;&gt;Solving the model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to find the allocations $K_x, L_x, K_y, L_y, x, y, w, r, K_x^\star, L_x^\star, K_y^\star, L_y^\star, x^\star, y^\star, \frac{p_x}{p_y}$ given endowments $K, L, K^\star, L^\star$, production functions and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, from the maximization of profits, we can derive:
\begin{align}
w &amp;amp;= p_x \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}(K_x,L_x)}{\partial L_x} =   p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}(K_y,L_y)}{\partial L_y} \\
r = p_x  \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}(K_x,L_x)}{\partial K_x} &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}(K_y,L_y)}{\partial K_y} \\
\\
w^\star &amp;amp;= p_x \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}(K_x^\star,L_x^\star)}{\partial L_x^\star} =   p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}(K_y^\star,L_y^\star)}{\partial L_y^\star} \\
r^\star = p_x  \frac{\partial \mathcal{X}(K_x^\star,L_x^\star)}{\partial K_x^\star} &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{\partial \mathcal{Y}(K_y^\star,L_y^\star)}{\partial K_y^\star}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the maximization of utility, we get the labor-capital ratio in each sector as a function of prices by solving:
\begin{align}
\frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPL_y}{MPK_y} \\
\frac{MPL_x^\star}{MPK_x^\star} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPL_y^\star}{MPK_y^\star}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have $\frac{L}{K}$ as a function of prices we can get the wage-to-rental rate also as a function of prices.
It is important to note that wages and rental rates depend only on labor-capital ratios and the prices, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; on the endowment.
At this stage, we have
\begin{align}
\frac{L_x}{K_x} &amp;amp;= f\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \\
\frac{L_y}{K_y} &amp;amp;= g\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \\
\frac{L_x^\star}{K_x^\star} &amp;amp;= f^\star\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \\
\frac{L_y^\star}{K_y^\star} &amp;amp;= g^\star\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \\
\frac{w}{r} = h\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \\
\frac{w^\star}{r^\star} = h^\star\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we can use $\frac{L}{K} = \frac{L_x}{K_x} \frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y} \frac{K_y}{K}$ to get the allocations in each sector as a function of prices.
Because $\frac{L}{K}$ is given (the country endowment) we can solve:
\begin{align}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= f\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \frac{K_x}{K} + g\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right) \frac{K-K_x}{K}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, retrieve $K_x$ and $K_y = K - K_x$ as a function of prices.
Finally, we can use $K_x$ and $L_x$ to find the amount produced in the xbox sector as a function of prices, and the same applies to yogurts.
This can of course done for both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the equilibrium price level with trade, we use the utility function to derive the demand for each good as a function of prices.
This is quite involved (specially if non-homothetic function are used) but the idea is to get the demand for each good as a function of prices.
From it, we can compute the supply of exports of xboxes from one country and the demand o imports of xboxes from the other country.
Equating supply of exports to demand of imports yields the equilibrium price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-2&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $\mathcal{X} = K_x^\frac{1}{2} L_x^\frac{1}{2}$ and $\mathcal{Y} = K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^\frac{2}{3}$.
Hence, the xbox sector is capital intensive while the yogurt sector is labor intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s solve for the model.
First, we need to find the labor-capital ratio in each sector as a function of prices.
Maximizing profits at home:
\begin{align}
max_{K_x,L_x} &amp;amp;\ \pi = p_x \mathcal{X} - w L_x - r K_x \\
0 &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial K_x} \implies r = p_x \frac{1}{2} K_x^{-\frac{1}{2}} L_x^\frac{1}{2} \\
0 &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial L_x} \implies w = p_x \frac{1}{2} K_x^\frac{1}{2} L_x^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\\
\max_{K_y,L_y} &amp;amp;\ \pi^\star = p_y \mathcal{Y} - w^\star L_y - r^\star K_y \\
0 &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial \pi^\star}{\partial K_y} \implies r = p_y \frac{1}{3} K_y^{-\frac{2}{3}} L_y^\frac{2}{3} \\
0 &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial \pi^\star}{\partial L_y} \implies w = p_y \frac{2}{3} K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^{-\frac{1}{3}}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because $w$ and $r$ are the same in both sectors:
\begin{align}
p_x \frac{1}{2} K_x^{-\frac{1}{2}} L_x^\frac{1}{2} &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{1}{3} K_y^{-\frac{2}{3}} L_y^\frac{2}{3} \\
p_x \frac{1}{2} K_x^\frac{1}{2} L_x^{-\frac{1}{2}} &amp;amp;= p_y \frac{2}{3} K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^{-\frac{1}{3}} \\
\\
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{1}{3} K_y^{-\frac{2}{3}} L_y^\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{2} K_x^{-\frac{1}{2}} L_x^\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}\frac{K_x^\frac{1}{2}L_y^\frac{2}{3}}{K_y^\frac{2}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right)^\frac{-1}{2} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{2}{3} \\&lt;br&gt;
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{\frac{2}{3} K_y^\frac{1}{3} L_y^{-\frac{1}{3}}}{\frac{1}{2} K_x^\frac{1}{2} L_x^{-\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{4}{3} \frac{K_y^\frac{1}{3}L_x^\frac{1}{2}}{K_x^\frac{1}{2}L_y^\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{4}{3} \left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{-1}{3}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the second we can write:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right)^\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \frac{p_x}{p_y} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-arranging the first equation gives:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right)^\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{2}{3}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, replacing:
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{4} \frac{p_x}{p_y} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{1}{3} &amp;amp;= \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{2}{3} \\
\frac{9}{8} \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^2 &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{1}{3} \\
\frac{L_y}{K_y} &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^3 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found the labor-capital ratio in the yogurt industry as a function of prices.
Then, we can use $  \left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right)^\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \frac{p_x}{p_y} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{L_x}{K_x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{2} \left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right)^\frac{2}{3}$ to retrieve $\frac{L_x}{K_x}$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_x}{K_x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{2} \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{27}{32}\right) ^2\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to find use the country endowments to derive $K_x$, $L_x$ and $K_y$, $L_y$ as a function of prices.
\begin{align}
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= \frac{L_x}{K_x}\frac{K_x}{K} + \frac{L_y}{K_y}\frac{K_y}{K} \\
\frac{L}{K} &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{27}{32}\right)^2 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 \frac{K_x}{K} + \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^3 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 \frac{K-K_x}{K} \\
K_x &amp;amp;= \frac{2\left(729 K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 - 512 L\right)}{729 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6} = 2K - \frac{1024}{729}L \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}
\end{align}
Therefore, we also have $K_y = K - K_x = \frac{1024}{729}L\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}-K$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can corroborate already that, when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, $K_x$ increases and $K_y$ decreases.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s find the levels $L_x$ and $L_y$:
\begin{align}
\frac{L_y}{K_y} &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^3 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 \implies L_y = 2L - \frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 \\
\frac{L_x}{K_x} &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{27}{32}\right)^2 \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 \implies L_x = \frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 - L
\end{align}
Here we can also confirm that when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, $L_x$ increases and $L_y$ decreases.
So, when $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ increases, the production of $x$ increases and the production of $y$ decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can indeed find the production as a function of prices:
\begin{align}
x = \mathcal{X}(K_x,L_x) = \left(2K - \frac{1024}{729}L \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 - L\right)^\frac{1}{2} \\
y = \mathcal{Y}(K_y,L_y) = \left(\frac{1024}{729}L\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}-K\right)^\frac{1}{3} \left(2L - \frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6\right)^\frac{2}{3}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This closes the supply part of the Hecksher-Ohlin model.
The next step is to derive the demand for $x$ and $y$ as a function of prices so that we can compute exports and imports.
We use here a simple utility formulation: $u(x,y) = \log(x) + \log(y)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the country producing the previously derived quantities, this means that utility has to be maximized on an isovalue line passing through that point and with slope equal to the relative prices.
This is:
\begin{align}
\max_{x,y} &amp;amp;= \log(x) + \log(y) \\
\text{s.t.} &amp;amp; p_x x + p_y y = \\
&amp;amp;= p_x \left(2K - \frac{1024}{729}L \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}\right)^\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6 - L\right)^\frac{1}{2} + \\
&amp;amp;+ p_y \left(\frac{1024}{729}L\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^{-6}-K\right)^\frac{1}{3} \left(2L - \frac{729}{512}K \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^6\right)^\frac{2}{3}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the maths become very messy (even more than what we have now)!
Once we maximize, we can obtain the demand for $x$ as a function of prices.
From here, determining the supply of exports is simple: production ($\mathcal{X}$) minus consumption.
Because we have the same production and utility function for both countries, demand for imports will be consumption minus production.
Note that we wrote the function without replacing values for $K$ and $L$, which will differ between countries and give rise to trade.
Finally, equating yields the equilibrium price level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;factor-prize-equalization&#34;&gt;Factor prize equalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without trade, capital earns less at Home than in Foreign because Home is capital-abundant, and labor earns more because Home is labor-abundant.
Similarly, the relative price of xboxes will be lower in Home before trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coutries open up to trade, the price of goods converges and becomes unique.
This price convergence also implies that factors earn the same in both countries: &lt;strong&gt;trade equalizes factor prices&lt;/strong&gt;.
Indeed, as we saw before, wages and rents do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; depend on the endowment of each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the set of conditions:
\begin{align}
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPK_y}{MPK_x} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} \\
\frac{p_x}{p_y} &amp;amp;= \frac{MPK_y^\star}{MPK_x^\star} = \frac{MPL_y^\star}{MPL_x^\star} \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find that equal labor-capital ratios must prevail for each sector across countries.
This is:
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{L_x}{K_x}\right) &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{L_x^}{K_x}\right)^\star \\
\left(\frac{L_y}{K_y}\right) &amp;amp;= \left(\frac{L_y^}{K_y}\right)^\star \\
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, because $\frac{w}{r} = \frac{MPL_x}{MPK_x} = \frac{MPL_y}{MPK_y}$, and $\frac{w^\star}{r^\star} = \frac{MPL_x^\star}{MPK_x^\star} = \frac{MPL_y^\star}{MPK_y^\star}$, we have that $\frac{w}{r} = \frac{w^\star}{r^\star}$, using the previous condition we arrive at $w = w^\star$ and $r = r^\star$.
This is, factor prices equalize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Empirics around Heckscher-Ohlin</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/heckscher-ohlin-empirics/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/heckscher-ohlin-empirics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heckscher-Ohlin offers some bold predictions but, at the same time, relies on some heavy assumptions.
Some interestig predictions that may be brought to the data are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countries with higher capital endowments should specialize in capital-intensive industries and export capital-intensive goods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wages and rental prices should converge across countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On perhaps unrealistic assumptions we can list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect factor mobility between industries
Can we really re-allocate a desertic land area to the production of timber?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One sector is always capital intensive, and the other labour intensive
Formally, this means that capital intensities do not switch at any given price level.
This restricts the possible set of production functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identical production technologies exist in both countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identical preferences exist in both countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-leontief-paradox&#34;&gt;The Leontief paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known tests on the Heckscher-Ohlin model was performed by Wassily Leontief in 1953. His analysis aimed to test the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction that countries should export goods that intensively use the country&amp;rsquo;s abundant factors of production.
In the case of the United States, a country with a high capital endowment relative to labor, the Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicted that the U.S. would predominantly export capital-intensive goods and import labor-intensive goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leontief used input-output tables to analyze the factor content of U.S. exports and imports. Surprisingly, his findings contradicted the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.
He discovered that U.S. exports were less capital-intensive and more labor-intensive than its imports.
This unexpected result became known as the &amp;ldquo;Leontief Paradox.&amp;rdquo;
It challenged the validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin model and sparked significant debate in the field of international economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/leontief.png&#34; alt=&#34;leontief&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tests have nuanced the positions.
Robert Baldwin re-examined the data for 1961 and revealed again that capital-intensive goods are more likely to be exported than imported.
However, exports used more educated labor than imports, and also employed more engineers.
In that sense, export were more skill-intensive, and the US is abundant in skilled labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/baldwin.png&#34; alt=&#34;baldwin&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study (Bowen, Leamer, Sveikauskas) focused on 27 countries and considered 12 production factors.
They compared the factor intensities of exports and imports to factor intensities of the countries, and classified those that followed the pattern predicted by the model.
For instance, a country that exports a capital-intensive good when the country is capital-intense confirms the Hecksher-Ohlin predictions.
However, the success was only 61%.
These results confirmed that the Leontief paradox was not an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These set of tests really casted doubt on one of the main hypothesis of the model: production functions are identical across countries.
Removing restrictive assumptions increases the performance of the model, as shown by Davis and Weinstein:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/davis_weinstein.png&#34; alt=&#34;davis_weinstein&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;winners-and-losers&#34;&gt;Winners and losers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hecksher-Ohlin model (in fact, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem) predicts that countries that specialize in capital-intensive industries will experience a rise in the relative price of capital, and a fall in the relative price of labor.
The prediction also holds for other factors, in particular, high-skilled and low-skilled workers.
In economics, we call high-skilled workers those who have accumulated multiple years of education, typically obtaining a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, a country that has a relative abundance of high-skilled workers (like the USA) should export high-skilled labor-intensive and, thus, the &lt;strong&gt;the wage of high-skilled workers should rise&lt;/strong&gt;.
This means that high-skilled workers in the USA should benefit from trade and globaization.
Moreover, because low-skilled workers see their wages decrease, they should &lt;strong&gt;oppose&lt;/strong&gt; to trade and ask the government to put in place tariffs and other protectionist measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data shows that this seems to be the case.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/mayda_rodrik.png&#34; alt=&#34;mayda_rodrik&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this graph, the average GDP per capita approximates the relative abundance of high-skilled workers: countries with high GDP per capita have more high-skilled workers.
For each country, the authors study the relationship between the education of an individual and whether he is pro-trade.
For instance, a highly-skilled person in Bangladesh should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be pro-trade, because Bangladesh has abundance of low-skilled workers.
In contrast, a Norweigian with a college degree should be pro-trade, because Norway has abundance of high-skilled workers.
The plot confirms the prediction of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Standard Trade Model</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous models seen in the first half of the course focus on particular aspects that may give rise to international trade.
In particular, the Ricardian model emphasizes differences in comparative advantages that can be ultimately related to different production functions.
The Heckscher-Ohlin model places the emphasis on the relative abundance of production factors.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
However, when dealing with real-world applications, these models may be too restrictive.
In fact, it is quite likely that the reasons behind trade include, up to some point, all the elements that these different models highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the two (three) models have some common elements, which make the building blocks of the Standard Trade Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The productive capacity of an economy is determined by its production possibility frontier.
Differences in this frontier give rise to trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production possibilities (and demand) determine a country&amp;rsquo;s relative supply schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World equilibrium is determined by world relative demand and world relative supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Model of Trade is built of four key relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relationship between the production possibility frontier and the relative supply curve,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relationship between relative prices and relative demand,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The determination of world equilibrium by world relative supply and world relative demand, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of the terms of trade (price of a country&amp;rsquo;s exports divided by the price of its imports) on a nation&amp;rsquo;s welfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;production-possibility-frontier-and-the-relative-supply-curve&#34;&gt;Production possibility frontier and the relative supply curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a situation very similar to that of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.
Suppose there are only two countries in the world, Home (H) and Foreign (F), and that two products are produced in each country, Food (F) and Clothing (C).
Of course, each sector is equipped with a unique technology, and in principle, technologies can be different in different countries.
Underlying these production functions, we have production factors.
For instance, in the Heckscher-Ohlin model we had two production factors: Capital (K) and Labour (L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing-the-production-possibility-frontier-ppf&#34;&gt;Drawing the production possibility frontier (PPF)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility frontier is a function that relates the quantities produced in each sector when the production processes use the same finite resources.
This is, in our case, the PPF indicates how many units of Food the economy can produce considering that it is currently producing $C$ units of clothing.
Of course, we assume that production is efficient, this is, the production factors $K$ and $L$ are allocated efficiently between sectors.
&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: an implicit assumption is that the economy makes use of all resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following production functions:
$$Q_F = H(K_F, L_F), \mathrm{and}, Q_C = G(K_C,L_C).$$
Since the economy uses all the available resources, we also have that
$$K = K_F + K_C, \mathrm{and}, L = L_F + L_C.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is a bit convoluted if we use generic functions.
However, we first describe the general process and then go through the details using an example.
The general objective is to find the maximum amount of good $F$ that the economy can produce considering that it is already producing $C$ units of clothing.
Moreover, we shall assume that production of $C$ is efficient.
If we then vary the amount of $C$, we can retrieve the PPF.
Hence, we are really solving the following constrained maximisation problem for a given level $C = \bar{C}.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{align}
\max_{K_F,L_F} &amp;amp; \, H(K_F, L_F) \\\
\mathrm{s.t.}     &amp;amp; \, G(K_C, L_C) = \bar{C},\\\
&amp;amp;K=K_F + K_C, \\\
&amp;amp;L = L_F + L_C.
\end{align}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we solve for the associated Lagrangian, we obtain the condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{H_{K_F}}{H_{L_F}} = \frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$$
And since $K=K_F + K_C$ and $L = L_F + L_C$
$$\frac{H_{K-K_C}}{H_{L-L_C}} = \frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous expression defines a relationship between capital used in the production of clothes $K_C$ and labour used in the production of clothes $L_C.$
For suitable cases, it is possible to isolate one of the two and obtain a closed-form solution $L_C = Z(K_C),$ where $Z(\cdot)$ is a function.
Lastly, we can write a parametric function for clothing and food production:
$$(Q_C\,,Q_F) = (G(K_C, Z(K_C)),\, H(K-K_C, L-Z(K_C))).$$
Finally, in some particular cases we can transform the parametric equation into an explicit relationship between $C$ and $F$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt;
Suppose that $H(K_F, L_F) = K_F^{\frac{1}{3}}L_F^{\frac{2}{3}}$ and $G(K_C,L_C) = K_C^{\frac{1}{2}} L_C^{\frac{1}{2}}.$
Since both sectors optimize, we have that $MRS$ across sectors coincide, this is, $\frac{H_{K_F}}{H_{L_F}} = \frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$
In our case, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\frac{1}{3}K_F^{-\frac{2}{3}}L_F^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\frac{2}{3}K_F^{\frac{1}{3}}L_F^{-\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}K_C^{-\frac{1}{2}}L_C^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\frac{1}{2}K_C^{\frac{1}{2}}L_C^{-\frac{1}{2}}}.$$
Or, after some simplifications,
$$\frac{1}{2}\frac{L_F}{K_F} = \frac{L_C}{K_C} \implies 2 L_C K_F = L_F K_C.$$
Since $K=K_F + K_C$ and $L = L_F + L_C$, we have,
$$2 L_C (K - K_C) = (L - L_C) K_C \implies L_C = \frac{L K_C}{2K - K_C}.$$
Finally, we can substitute everything in the production functions to obtain the parametric functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{align}
(Q_C,\, Q_F) &amp;amp;= \left(G(K_C, L_C),\, H(K_F, L_F)\right) = \\\
&amp;amp;=\left(G\left(K_C, \frac{L K_C}{2K - K_C}\right),\, H\left(K-K_F, L-\frac{L K_C}{2K - K_C}\right)\right) = \\\
&amp;amp;=\left(K_C^\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{L K_C}{2K - K_C}\right)^\frac{1}{2},\, (K-K_C)^\frac{1}{3} \left(L-\frac{L K_C}{2K - K_C}\right)^\frac{2}{3}\right).
\end{align}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, we can isolate $K_C$ from the equation for $C$ and obtain
$$K_C = \frac{Q_C \sqrt{Q_C^2+4LK}-Q_C^2}{2L}.$$
Finally, we can plug this expression for $K_C$ into the parametric equation of $F$ and obtain the quantity of food that the economy can produce as a function of the number of clothing:
$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp; Q_F = \\\
&amp;amp; = \left(K-\frac{Q_C \sqrt{Q_C^2+8LK}-Q_C^2}{2L}\right)^\frac{1}{3} \left(L-\frac{L\frac{Q_C \sqrt{Q_C^2+8LK}-Q_C^2}{2L}}{2K -\frac{Q_C \sqrt{Q_C^2+8LK}-Q_C^2}{2L}}\right)^\frac{2}{3}
\end{align}$$
If we assume, for a second, that the economy counts with $10$ units of labour $(L=10)$ and $5$ units of capital $(K=5)$, then the production possibility frontier has the following shape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/PPF.png&#34; alt=&#34;PPF&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deciding-how-much-to-produce&#34;&gt;Deciding how much to produce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PPF only indicates all the possible combinations of clothing and food that the economy can produce.
For instance, points such as $A$ and $B$ are feasible, so is any other point on the PPF.
The point at which the economy produces depends on the relative price of cloth relative to food: $\frac{P_C}{P_F}.$
In particular, for prices $P_C$ and $P_F$, the economy will maximise the value of its total production, this is, the economy maximises
$$V = Q_C P_C + Q_F P_F.$$
Levels $V$ are called isovalue lines: combinations of $Q_C$ and $Q_F$ that produce the same value $V.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering, for instance, that $P_C = 7$ and $P_F = 6$, we can draw several isolines corresponding to different values $V$.
The next figure draws isovalue lines for values $V = {20,40,60}.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Isovalues.png&#34; alt=&#34;Isovalue_lines&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To draw one isovalue line for a given $V$, we isolate the variable in the vertical axis, this is, $Q_F$ in our case:
$$V = Q_C P_C + Q_F P_F \implies Q_F = \frac{V}{P_F} - \frac{P_C}{P_F}Q_C.$$
As is clear, as we increase the $V$, the isovalue lines move away from the origin.
Also, the slope of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the isovalue lines is the same (unless we change prices) and it corresponds to the relative price of $Q_C,$ $-\frac{P_C}{P_F}.$
So, for a given set of prices $P_C$ and $P_F$, the economy chooses the combination $(Q_C^\star, Q_F^\star)$ that maximises the value $V.$
This is, the economy solves the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{align}
\max_{Q_C, Q_F} &amp;amp; P_C Q_C + P_F Q_F \\\
\mathrm{s.t.} &amp;amp; \, Q_F = F(Q_C)
\end{align},$$
where $Q_F = F(Q_C)$ represents the PPF, because the amount of food the economy is produces depends on the number of cloth it produces, as we have just seen.
If we solve this maximisation we obtain the following optimality condition:
$$F^\prime(Q_C) = -\frac{P_C}{P_F}.$$
This condition indicates that the economy will produce at the point in which the PPF is tangent to the isovalue line.
This is normal: suppose that we selected a point such as $A$ below.
At this point, the economy is not producing at its full capacity because it is inside the PPF.
We already know that we can increase the value of total production if we move the isovalue line away from the origin.
Points like $B$ or $C$ are not feasible, because they are above the PPF and, thus, the economy cannot produce these combinations $Q_C$ and $Q_F$ with its available resources $K$ and $L$.
Thus, it is optimal to lie on the point that is the farthest away which still touches the PPF: the tangency point $D$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/PPF_optimal.png&#34; alt=&#34;PPF_Optimal&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the relative price changes, the slope of the isovalue lines change.
For instance, if $P_C$ increases, making clothing more valuable, the slope (in absolute value) increases.
This has the consequence of changing the optimal point.
In particular, if $P_C$ increases, the economy can become richer by shifting production to clothing, because its price increases.
Graphically, the new point of tangency is characterised by an increase in $Q_C$ and, consequently, a decrease in $Q_F.$
Mathematically, we can see this because we know that $Q_F$ is a function of $Q_C$, for instance, $Q_F = F(Q_C).$
Therefore, the optimal production point is characterised by, as we just saw,
$$F^\prime(Q_C) = -\frac{P_C}{P_F}.$$
If we compute the how $Q_C$ changes with a change in $P_C$ we obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\partial Q_C}{\partial P_C} = - \frac{1}{P_F F^{\prime \prime}(Q_C)}.$$
Looking at the form of $F(Q_C)$, we know that $F^{\prime \prime}(Q_C)$ is negative ($F^{\prime \prime}(Q_C)$), and therefore,
$$\frac{\partial Q_C}{\partial P_C} = - \frac{1}{P_F F^{\prime \prime}(Q_C)} &amp;gt; 0.$$
So, as the intuition suggested, when the price of clothing increases, the economy produces more of it.
We could also show that the quantity of food decreases.
Hence, the relative supply of cloth $\left(\frac{Q_C}{Q_F}\right)$ increases.
Finally, we can draw the relative supply curve of the economy, this is, how $\left(\frac{Q_C}{Q_F}\right)$ changes when the relative price $\left(\frac{P_C}{P_F}\right)$ changes.
As $Q_C$ increases and $Q_F$ decreases following the rise if $P_C$, it is easy to see that the ration $\frac{Q_C}{Q_F}$ will increase as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;individuals-preferences-and-the-relative-demand-curve&#34;&gt;Individuals&amp;rsquo; preferences and the relative demand curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tastes of an individual are represented by a series of indifference curves: the set of points on the $(Q_C, Q_F)$ plane that generate a utility level $\bar{U}.$
These indifferences curves have three main properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are downward sloping: if an individual receives less units of food, she has to be compensated with more clothing to achieve the same utility level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curves farther away from the origin represent higher levels of welfare, this is, higher values $\bar{U}.$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a given curve, it becomes flatter as one moves to the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, we can write the indifference curves by plotting $\bar{U} = U(Q_C, Q_F)$ for different values of $\bar{U}$, where $U(\cdot, \cdot)$ represents the utility function.
The next Figure plots several indifference curves, with values $\bar{U} = {1, 1.2, 1.4}$ and using $U(Q_C, Q_F) = \log(Q_C)+\log(Q_F).$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Indifference_curves.png&#34; alt=&#34;Indifference&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that the economy can trade at the prices $P_C,\, P_F$, individuals will optimize according to them.
Hence, they will choose a consumption bundle such that utility is maximal and tangent to the relative price line.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; without trade, the efficient point will be one such that the PPF and the indifference curves are tangent, which would determine the prices within the country.
Hence, given prices $P_C$ and $P_F$, consumers maximize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\max_{Q_C,\, Q_F} U(Q_C,\, Q_F) \\\
&amp;amp; \mathrm{s.t.}\, P_C Q_C + Q_F P_F = V
\end{align}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $V$ represents the total value of production.
Such equilibrium is represented in the Figure below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Equilibrium.png&#34; alt=&#34;Equilibrium&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we did before, we can consider the effect of an increase in $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$.
First, as we already knew, the economy produces more clothing $C$ and less food $F$.
This is because the relative price of clothing with respect to food increased, and it is more profitable to produce and sell clothing.
Hence, the value of total production has increased (the economy produces more of the good that has become more expensive).
On the other side of the market, consumers&amp;rsquo; income has also increased: the total income of an economy is the total value of production.
Effectively, this means that the new equilibrium indifference curve must lie on the isovalue line.
However, consumers face two effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;wealth&lt;/strong&gt; effect: now that income is larger, they want to consume more of all goods,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;substitution&lt;/strong&gt; effect: the rise in $P_C$ relative to $P_F$ makes consuming clothing less attractive because it costs more.
Therefore, consumers tend to consume less of $C$ and more of $F$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the utility representation, one effect dominates the other (and for the utility choice we made, one exactly cancels out the other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Change_Equilibrium.png&#34; alt=&#34;Change_Equilibrium&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the relative supply curve, we can draw a relative demand curve which represents the relative demand $\frac{Q_C}{Q_F}$ with respect to the relative price $\frac{P_Q}{P_F}.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Relative_supply_and_demand.png&#34; alt=&#34;Relative_supply_and_demand&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-terms-of-trade&#34;&gt;The terms of trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the relative price of clothing increases, this is, when $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$ increases, a country that exports clothing is better off.
And, by the same token, when the relative price of clothing falls, that country is in a worse position.
Of course, these effects depend on whether the country exports clothing or food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a better way of tracking the effects of price changes, we define &lt;strong&gt;the terms of trade&lt;/strong&gt; as the price of the good a country initially &lt;strong&gt;exports&lt;/strong&gt; divided by the price of the good that it &lt;strong&gt;imports&lt;/strong&gt;.
In general, a &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; in the terms of trade increases a country&amp;rsquo;s welfare, and a decline in the terms of trade reduces its welfare.
However, it is important to remark that welfare can never be below its level under autarky: if that were the case, the economy would just stop trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-countries&#34;&gt;Two countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now introduce two countries in our analysis.
We assume that both countries produce the two goods, but &lt;strong&gt;Home exports cloth&lt;/strong&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;Foreign exports food&lt;/strong&gt;.
The terms of trade of Home are measured as $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$ while Foreign&amp;rsquo;s are $\frac{P_F}{P_C}$.
Lastly, we suppose that trade arises because of fundamental differences in the production technology, which will be reflected in their PPF and their relative supply curves.
For instance, Home is more productive in producing cloth.
To simplify, we assume that demand in both countries is exactly the same.
As usual, equilibrium points are found by equalizing the slope of the PPF in each country to the world relative prices, as depicted below:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Production_in_each_country.png&#34; alt=&#34;Production_in_each_country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

The world-level relative supply of clothing and food can be computed by aggregating from the country level:
$$\frac{Q_C^{world}}{Q_F^{world}} = \frac{Q_C + Q_C^\star}{Q_F + Q_F^\star}.$$
Note that, in reality, the world relative supply is a weighted average of each country&amp;rsquo;s relative supply curve.
Hence, the world relative supply always lies in between the two countries&amp;rsquo; relative supply curves.
We can proceed similarly for world relative demand.
However, since we assumed that demand is exactly the same in both countries, the world relative demand will coincide be equal to the relative demand curve of either country.
The Figure below illustrates the case:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/World_relative_supply_and_demand.png&#34; alt=&#34;World_relative_supply_and_demand&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-the-terms-of-trade-and-welfare&#34;&gt;Growth, the terms of trade and welfare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classical question in international economics concerns the effects of biased economic growth on trade and, hence, welfare.
If all other countries in the world grow, is it good or bad for our economy?
It is possible to argue in the positive and in the negative sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If other countries grow, it means that the market size for our exports increases, so we can export and sell, hence we are better off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But our firms also face higher competition from the foreign countries, which hurts welfare in our country.
Similarly, if it is our country the one that grows, we also have opposite effects:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are growing, we produce more and we can sell of this additional production abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But also, by increasing production the price of the goods falls, so we earn less from exporting, which has a negative effect on welfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, whether growth is positive or negative heavily depends on the direction of growth.
First, economic growth means that we can produce more of all goods, so that PPF moves outwards.
However, growth typically benefits more one sector than the others: we call this &lt;strong&gt;biased growth&lt;/strong&gt;.
Graphically, it means that the PPF moves outwards much more for one sector than the other.
The figure below depicts and exaggerated case.
What is really important is that, for unchanged relative prices, the economy produces more of the good in which there is a bias and less of the other.
For instance, if there is biased growth in terms of clothing, the economy will produce more clothing and less food.
We can intuitively see this by studying the optimisation problem.
Before, we have established that we can write the amount of labour in each sector as a function of capital: $L_C = L(K_C).$
We also know that capital and labour not employed in the clothing industry will be used in the food industry, hence $K_F = K - K_C$ and $L_F = L - L_C = L - L(K_C).$
Thus, in fact, given the relative price, the economy only has to determine how much capital to allocate to the clothing sector, and optimality conditions will tell us how much labour we shall allocate to it.
Lastly, market clearing will indicate the amounts of capital and labour in the food sector.
So, the economy solves:
$$\max_{K_C} p F\left(K_C, L(K_C)\right) + G\left(K - K_C, L - L(K_C)\right),$$
where $p$ represents the relative price $\frac{P_C}{P_F}.$
Taking the derivative with respect to $K_C$
$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\frac{\partial p F\left(K_C, L(K_C)\right) + G\left(K - K_C, L - L(K_C)\right)}{\partial K_C} = 0 \implies \\\
&amp;amp;\implies p\left[F^\prime_K + F^\prime_L L^\prime\right] = G^\prime_K + G^\prime_L L^\prime.
\end{align}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biased&lt;/strong&gt; technological growth implies unequal productivity growth, this is, the productivity increases much more in the clothing sector than in the food sector.
Mathematically, this means that the derivatives $F^\prime$ increase much more than the $G^\prime.$
If the relative price $p$ remains constant, there is an imbalance in the equation: the left-hand side is larger than the right-hand side.
To rebalance it, we shall make $F^\prime$ decrease and $G^\prime$ increase, and this happens when $K_C$ increases.
So, with more capital in the clothing sector, the economy clearly produces more clothing and less food.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Biased_growth.png&#34; alt=&#34;Biased_growth&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Of course, biased growth towards clothing implies an increase in the relative supply (of clothing), while an biased growth towards food implies a decrease in the relative supply (of clothing).
So we can now answer our question:
Suppose Home grows, and the growth is biased towards clothing.
Hence, Home&amp;rsquo;s relative supply of clothing increases at any given set of relative prices.
This also implies that the world relative supply of clothing will increase, moving towards the right.
As a result of that shift, in equilibrium, the new relative price of clothing decreases.
If Home exported clothing, a lower relative price of clothing worsens its terms of trade, and it improve Foreign&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade (it exports food).
&lt;strong&gt;Remark:&lt;/strong&gt; it does not really matter which country grows, but the direction of growth.
Growth biased towards the good that Home exports always worsens Home&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade; while any growth biased in the good that Home imports improves Home&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effects-of-economic-growth&#34;&gt;Effects of economic growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now analyse the effects of economic growth on welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-rest-of-the-world-grows&#34;&gt;The rest of the world grows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose first that the rest of the world is growing.
If the growth is export-biased, this is, growth occurs in their exporting sector, this is good for us.
The reason is that it improves our terms of trade: the good we import is cheaper, and welfare at home increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, instead, their growth is import-biased (in the sense that they grow in the sector Foreign imports), it worsens our terms of trade: the rest of the world is growing in the sector we export.
Thus, welfare at home decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;home-grows&#34;&gt;Home grows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s focus now on what happens we Home grows.
If the growth is import-biased, then these are goods news as we are growing in the sector we imported, reducing its price and improving our terms of trade.
The interesting case is what happens when growth at Home is export-biased.
On the one hand, this reduces our terms of trade and decreases welfare at home.
However, on the other hand, Home produces more and can export more goods, which is good.
In general, the increase in exports compensates the decrease in the relative price.
&lt;strong&gt;Only&lt;/strong&gt; when growth is extremely biased such that the price of the good really falls, then we can have immiserising growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immiserising growth
In any case, during the 1950s, there were concerns about the implications of poor nations&amp;rsquo; economic growth.
Poor countries exported mostly raw materials, and growth in these countries was expected to be specially intense in the extractive sectors.
This would, of course, hurt their terms of trade because these countries would experience export-biased growth.
At the same time, it was likely that developed countries could create synthetic substitutes for imported raw materials, hence these countries will be import-biased growing, improving their terms of trade and worsening those of poor economies.
To some, the growth of the poor economies will be make them actually worse, this is, poor economies would be better off not growing at all, insofar as export-biased growth was harmful for them.
Although the possibility can arise from a theoretical model, Bhagwati (1958) shows that it only materialises when strong export-biased growth is combined with vey steep RS and RD curves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This family of models can be enlarged by including the &lt;em&gt;specific factors model&lt;/em&gt;, which features different productive factors, like the Heckscher-Ohlin, but some of these factors are immobile between sectors.
For instance, land can only be used in agriculture.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trade Policy</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous lectures indicate that, at the country level, an economy is in general better off when trading.
However, the gains o trade are not euqally shared among all citizens.
For instance, trade liberalization may benefit consumers by reducing the cost of the goods they want to consume, but at the same time hurt the local producers of these very same products, who now face international competition.
Moreover, although it may be posible for the winners to compensate the losers and still be better off (after all, trade is usually Pareto efficient), such implementation is nearely impossible.
For instance, it would require that all consumers of imported goods pay a &amp;ldquo;tax&amp;rdquo; to the loosing industries, which is expensive to implement.
Since the losers are typically less and can coordinate more easily, in general they successfully block trade liberalization.
After all, the general public who would benefit gains very little, and thus is not that much concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can classify trade policy tools in two broad categories, depending on whether they act upon prices or quantities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trariff barriers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-tariff barriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, protection against foreign trade appears in the form of &lt;strong&gt;tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;, a tax that an importer thas to pay to ship the goods into the country.
Throughout this section, we will use partial equilibrium analyse the changes induced by the different trade policies.
We are going to analyse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export subsidies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liaison mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import quotas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Tariffs</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/tariffs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/tariffs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tariffs&#34;&gt;Tariffs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods.
Therefore, if a country imported goods at the world price $p^w$, after the introduction of a tariff imported goods are more expensive because they now bear an extra tax.
This tax may take two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A percentage increase $p^w(1+\tau)$, called &lt;strong&gt;ad-valorem&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unitary increase $p^w + \tau$, called &lt;strong&gt;specific tariff&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are equivalent, and one can always find the corresponding percentage increase for a given unitary rise or vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shall see, the effects of a tariff are different depending on the size of the country.
First, we will analyze the &lt;strong&gt;small-country&lt;/strong&gt; case, this is, a country whose relative size in the international markers is small and cannot influence equilibrium prices.
Related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/&#34;&gt;Standard Trade model&lt;/a&gt;, a country is small if the changes in its supply or demand schedule do not move the world supply or demand.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Then, we will analyze the same tariff but when it is applied in a large country, one that has the ability to influence world prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tariffs-in-a-small-open-economy&#34;&gt;Tariffs in a small, open economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial situation is that of a country that is importing the good $X$.
This happens because the autarkic equilibrium price, this is, the one that would prevail without trade ($p$), is higher than the world price ($p^w$) of good $X$.
Then, if trade is possible and there are no tariffs, consumers will prefer to import the good and pay the lower internationa price rather than buying from the more expensive local producers.
The next Figure represents this initial situation: at price $p^w$, the country experiences excess demand, hence it imports the good.
Since the country is small, it can import any quantity it desires at the ongoing world price.
So, the world supply curve is perfectly elastic.
At price $p^w$, demand is $D^1$ and supply is $S^1$.
The difference between the two is the amount of imports.
As we can see, at price $p^w$ there is some local production: only the most efficient producers can supply at a price equal or lower than $p^w$.
From the perspective of a local firm, the situation is simple: if it asks a price above $p^w$, sales are zero because it is always possible to import at $p^w$.
If the price it asks is lower, the firm could gain more by adjusting it to $p^w$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we suppose that the government introduces a tariff $\tau &amp;gt; 0$ on imports.
Imports are still possible, however, the price of these goods is now $p^w + \tau$.
Notice that now more local firms produce: in fact, some that before were not sufficiently efficient to produce below $p^w$ can now produce because the relevant price is $p^w + \tau$.
So, local supply increases.
At the same time, with a higher price, demand shrinks.
The combined effect is a decrease in the imports: less demand combined with a higher local supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the government raises some revenue through the tariff.
For each imported good, it receives the tariff $\tau$.
Therefore, the total government revenue is $(D^2 - S^2)\tau$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, after the tariff is introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local producers are better off: they sell more and at a higher price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers are worse off: the price has increased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government raises some revenue.
It is normal to ask: in general, is the economy better off with the tariff?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;a small country&lt;/em&gt; the answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.
We can proof this.
Total consumer&amp;rsquo;s surplus before the tax was equal to the area below the demand curve, reaching until $D^1$, net of the purchase cost.
After the tariff, their surplus only extends until $D^2$, and because $D^2 &amp;lt; D^1$, it is clearly smaller.
However, if we aggregate all surplus changes, the entire result is a &lt;strong&gt;net loss of welfare&lt;/strong&gt;, a dead-weight loss.
Figures below illustrate it for linear supply and demand functions.
The consumer lost surplus equal to the area represented by the orange trapezoid.
The loss comprises two different aspects: consumers buy less quantity, and they do so at a higher price.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

The opposite is true for producers, represented by the blue area.
Notice how part of the surplus lost by consumers goes directly to the producers: they now satisfy a part of the demand that previously consisted of imports.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Lastly, the government gains the surplus depicted by the green rectangle.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

If add them together, the result is that the two red triangles are lost, hence the economy as whole is worse off.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tariffs-in-a-large-economy&#34;&gt;Tariffs in a large economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between a small and a large economy is their capacity to influence the world price.
Suppose for instance that the world consists of only two countries: if Home imports the good X, then Home has monopsony power.
In general, we say that a large country capable of influencing world prices faces an upwards supply curve.
We can derive this curve, as well as the world demand curve, from each country&amp;rsquo;s supply and demand schedules.
Suppose, for a given good, that the autarky price at Home is higher than a Foreign.
Consumers at Home will be willing to import the less expensive Foreign good, and hence, there will be internation demand for imports steeming from Home.
Similarly, producers in Foreign will be willing to sell goods in Home, hence, there is going to be an international supply.
Next, we shall determine how much Home is willing to import.
Let demand in Home $D^H(p)$, and similarly, supply will be $S^H(p)$.
At the autarky price $p^H$, $D^H(p^H) = S^H(p^H).$
However, if the price was lower than that, then demand exceeds supply.
The demand for imports is exactly the quantity demanded not covered with local production, this is,
$$D^{W}(p) = D^H(p) - S^H(p), \forall p\leq p^H.$$
We can think similarly about international supply:
$$S^{W}(p) = S^F(p) - D^F(p) \forall p\geq p^F.$$
Graphically:

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/International_Supply.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Supply&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Compute_Equilibrium.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Eq&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose now that Home introduces a tariff $\tau$ for each unit imported.
The world supply curve adjusts, moving up by $\tau$: if before an exporter was willing to sell at price $p$, now he will request a price $p+\tau$ to compensate for the tariff he has to pay upon entering the country.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, for each and every quantity, the world supply curve moves up by the amount $\tau.$
A new equilibrium is formed, which solves:
$$D^W(p) = S^W(p-\tau).$$
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the function $S^W$ indicates the &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; supplied at the price $p-\tau.$
However, in general we think of supply and demand functions as functions relating a quantity $Q$ to a price $p$, this is, $p=F(Q).$
Suppose a producer facing the tariff $\tau.$
To maintain his earnings unchanged, a producer selling $Q$ units will as a price $F(Q) + \tau$.
Consequently, $p = F(Q) + \tau \implies Q=F^{-1}(p-\tau),$ and this is the reason we wrote $S^W(p-\tau)$ before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Tariff_in_Large_Country.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Tariff_Large_Country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things must be commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Althugh the tariff is $\tau$, the price payed by consumers $p^\mathrm{consumer}$ only increases by a fraction of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining part is absorbed by exporters, who now earn $p^\mathrm{exporter}$, which is less than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result of the increased priced in Home:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home production increases,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home consumption decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government collects tariff duties for value $\tau (D^H(p^\mathrm{consumer}) - S^H(p^\mathrm{consumer})).$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes have an additional implication:
A large country is able to pass a part of the dead-weight cost to the Foreign market, who now receives a smaller price for its exports.
For a small country, this was a net loss for consumers.
So, if a country is able to pass onto the foreign market a relatively large part of the burden imposed by a tariff, it may be better off with an import tariff than without.
Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Tariff_in_Large_Country_2.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Tariff_Large_Country&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

As before, the consumer&amp;rsquo;s loss (blue) is partly compensated by the producers&amp;rsquo; increase in welfare (orange) and government revenue (green).
However, a large country clearly passes away part of the losses (red), which are collected as tariffs.
Then, it is possible for the red area to compensate the two blue triangles that are still lost by the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can show that the optimal tariff is always positive
As we have seen, when a country introduces a tariff of value $\tau$, a fraction of it is passed to foreign exporters and the remaining is repercuted onto the consumers.
To simplify, suppose that, after the tariff $\tau$ is introduced, consumers at Home end up paying $p^w + \alpha \tau, \alpha \in (0,1)$.
The total welfare in the economy is the sum of consumers&amp;rsquo; surplus, producers&amp;rsquo; surplus and government income raised by the tariff.
Let&amp;rsquo;s denote Home supply and demand, as functions of price, by $S(p)$ and $D(p)$, respectively.
Then, consumers&amp;rsquo; surplus is given by:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Change_in_Surplus.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Consumer_surplus&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

$$\int_{p^w+\alpha \tau}^\infty D(p)\mathrm{d}p$$
Similarly, producers&amp;rsquo; surplus is:
$$\int_0^{p^w+\alpha \tau}S(p)\mathrm{d}p$$
And governemnt raises tariffs by value:
$$\tau \underbrace{(D(p^w+\alpha \tau) - S(p^w + \alpha \tau))}_{\mathrm{Imports}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, total welfare is
$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp; W(p^w, \tau) = \int_{p^w+\alpha \tau}^\infty D(p)\mathrm{d}p + \\\
&amp;amp; \int_0^{p^w+\alpha \tau}S(p)\mathrm{d}p + \\\
&amp;amp; \tau \underbrace{(D(p^w+\alpha \tau) - S(p^w + \alpha \tau))}_{\mathrm{Imports}}
\end{align}$$
We study how it changes when $\tau = 0$, this is, whether, starting with &lt;strong&gt;no tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;, increasing the tariff rate by a tiny amount increases or decreases welfare.
To do so, we compute the derivative of total welfare with respect to $\tau$ and evaluate it at $\tau = 0$.
$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp; \left.\frac{\partial W(p^w, \tau)}{\partial \tau}\right|_{\tau = 0} = \\\
&amp;amp;-D(p^w+\alpha \tau) \alpha + S(p^w+\alpha \tau) \alpha + \left(D(p^w + \alpha \tau) - S(p^w+\alpha \tau)\right) = \\\
&amp;amp;(1-\alpha)\underbrace{\left[D(p^w+\alpha \tau) - S(p^w +\alpha \tau)\right]}_{\text{=Imports &amp;gt; 0}} &amp;gt; 0
\end{align}$$
Since the previous derivative is positive, this means that, when the tariff is zero, if we increase $\tau$ then welfare increases (as long as $\alpha \in (0,1).$
Notice also that, in the case of a small open economy, we have $\alpha = 1$, this is, the entire tariff is passed onto Home consumers.
In that case, $\left.\frac{\partial W(p^w, \tau)}{\partial \tau}\right|_{\tau = 0} = 0$, meaning that a tariff $\tau = 0$ is indeed optimal.
This makes sense: for a small open economy, we have seen than any positive tariff hurts the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we discuss how the value $\alpha$, this is, the part of the tariff that is passed to Home consumers, is determined.
In the international market, the equilibrium price $p^w$ is determined by the intersection between the world supply and world demand.
If we add a tariff, then the equilibrium price solves:
$$S_w(p^w - \tau) = D_w(p^w).$$
In that case, the exporters will receive $p^w-\tau$, the consumer pays $p^w$ and $\tau$ is collected by the government.
We can compute how a change in $\tau$ affects the equilibrium price:
$$\begin{align}
&amp;amp; S^\prime_w \mathrm{d}p^w - S^\prime_w \mathrm{d}\tau - D^\prime_w \mathrm{d}p = 0 \implies \\\
&amp;amp; \frac{\mathrm{d}p^w}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = \frac{S^\prime_w}{S^\prime_w - D^\prime_w} = \frac{\epsilon_S}{\epsilon_S-\epsilon_D} \in (0,1)
\end{align}$$
where $\epsilon$ denotes the elasticity, and $\epsilon_D &amp;lt; 0$.
Since the consumer pays $p^w$, then, the &lt;strong&gt;entire burden of a tariff is passed on to Home consumers when&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World supply is infinitely elastic ($\epsilon_S \rightarrow \infty$): this is the case of a small economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home demand is completely inelastic ($\epsilon_D = 0$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that we can describe the Home economy by the following supply and demand equations:
$$P^{H}_{D}(q) = 10 - q, \quad P^{H}_{S}(q) = -5 + 2q.$$
We can compute the autarky equilibrium by solving $P^{H}_{S}(q) = P^{H}_{D}(q)$ which will yield the equilibrium quantity $q^{H}_{Aut.}.$
In our case, $q^{H}_{Aut.} = 5$ and the autarky price is $p^{H}_{Aut.} = 5.$
Lastly, if we assume that Home will import from the international market, we can compute the excess demand (or the demand for imports).
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: we first must find the inverse of the demand and supply, so that we can compare &lt;em&gt;quantities&lt;/em&gt;.
$$Q^{H}_{D}(p) = 10 - p, \quad Q^{H}_{S}(p) = \frac{5+p}{2}.$$
Therefore, demand for imports will be:
$$Q^{I}(p) = Q^{H}_{D}(p) - Q^{H}_{S}(p) = \frac{15-3p}{2}, \quad p &amp;lt; 5$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, suppose that Foreign has the following supply and demand schedules
$$P^{F}_{D}(q) = 31 - 3q, \quad P^{F}_{S}(q) = -5 + q.$$
We can compute the autarky equilibrium by solving $P^{F}_{S}(q) = P^{F}_{D}(q)$ which will yield the equilibrium quantity $q^{F}_{Aut.}.$
In our case, $q^{F}_{Aut.} = 9$ and the autarky price is $p^{H}_{Aut.} = 4.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already verify that Home will import and Foreign export because the autarky price at Home is larger than in Foreign.
The supply of exports from Foreign is given by (again, remember to compare quantities):
$$Q^{F}_{S}(p) = \frac{31 - p}{3}, \quad Q^{H}_{S}(p) = 5+p.$$
Therefore,
$$Q^{E}(p) = Q^{F}_{S}(p) - Q^{F}_{D}(p) = \frac{-16 + 4p}{3}, \quad p &amp;gt; 4$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some additional notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, notice that demand for imports decreases in $p$ and supply of exports increases with $p$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, the international equilibrium price &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be between the two autarky prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can compute the international equilibrium price and quantity (the quantity refers to the amount of goods internationally traded).
$$Q^{E}(p) = Q^{I}(p) \implies p^{Int.} = \frac{77}{17} = 4.52 \quad Q^{I} = Q^{E} = \frac{12}{17} = 0.70.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Home, a large country, imposes a specific tariff on imports of value $\tau = 0.1$.
We will solve the new equilibrium using three methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assume-that-exporters-pay-the-tariff&#34;&gt;Assume that exporters pay the tariff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we suppose that exporters pay the tariff.
This is, we assume that for every good that crosses the border, the customs charge $0.1$ and the exporter has to pay it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand well how the introduction of a tariff affects the supply of exports, it is important to first realize what a supply (or demand) curve indicates.
In our case, we have the following expression for the supply of exports:
$$Q^{E}(p) = Q^{F}_{S}(p) - Q^{F}_{D}(p) = \frac{-16 + 4p}{3}, \quad p &amp;gt; 4.$$
If we compute its inverse, we get:
$$P^{E}(q) = 4 + \frac{3}{4} q.$$
This equation indicates the willingness to sell, this is, the monetary amount at which a seller is willing to sell $q$ units of goods.
For instance, they are ready to sell $q = 4$ units at a price of $p = 7.$
In other words, to sell these $3$ units, they must receive $7$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, once the tariff is levied, suppliers will increase the monetary amount they ask by the value of the tariff.
Following with our previous example, to sell the previous $4$ units they will ask consumers $7.1$.
Of these, $0.1$ will go to the customs agent, and sellers will be left with $7$, exactly the monetary amount at which they are willing to sell $&lt;a href=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;$ units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same argument can be applied at each and every quantity.
Therefore, in general, the price at which suppliers will be willing to sell increases by the amount of the tariff.
This is,
$$P^{E}(q) = 4 + \frac{3}{4} q + 0.1$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite the equation for the demand for imports to express the price as a function of quantities
$$Q^{I}(p) = Q^{H}_{D}(p) - Q^{H}_{S}(p) = \frac{15-3p}{2}, \implies P^{I}(q) = 5 - \frac{2}{3}q$$
and equalize $Q^{E}(q) = Q^{I}(q) \implies q = 0.635\quad p = 4.57.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice this is the equilibrium price that customers will pay.
However, exporters will earn $4.57 - 0.1 = 4.47$ because they have to pay the tariff.
We shall remark that the price the consumers pay increases, but by less than the tariff: it goes from 4.52 to 4.57.
Similarly, producers end up earning 4.47 instead of 4.52.
So, as is clear, a large economy can pass part of the burden introduced by a tariff to foreign producers by decreasing the international price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assume-that-consumers-pay-the-tariff&#34;&gt;Assume that consumers pay the tariff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, we suppose instead that when a consumer buys an imported good, he has to pay the tariff.
Therefore, demand for imports changes.
As before, it makes more sense to work with the inverse demand for imports.
From $Q^{I}(p) = Q^{H}_{D}(p) - Q^{H}_{S}(p) = \frac{15-3p}{2}$ we can derive $P^{I}(q) = 5  - \frac{2}{3} q$.
This function indicates willingness to pay for a certain amount of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that an agent wanted to purchase $q = 3$ units.
He was willing to pay a price of $3$.
But, after the tariff is introduced, he will be charged $3.1 &amp;gt; 3$, which is more than his willingness to pay for this quantity.
Consequently, once the tariff is implemented, his willingness to pay becomes
$$P^{I}(q) = 5 - \frac{2}{3} q - 0.1.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we solve for the new international equilibrium.
Supply of exports can be rewritten as $P^{E}(q) = 4 + \frac{4}{3} q$ so that, equalizing
$P^{E}(q) = P^{I}(q) \implies q = 0.635\quad p = 4.47.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, the equilibrium price indicates the amount that exporters will receive (which coincides with the one above).
However, consumers pay $4.47 + 0.1 = 4.57$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-the-gap&#34;&gt;Find the gap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we can also solve for the new equilibrium by using the fact that there is a gap between the price payed by consumers and the amount of money received by producers.
Moreover, we know that this difference is equal to the tariff.
Therefore, we can solve (these are the original functions, also make sure that you are comparing &lt;em&gt;prices&lt;/em&gt;).
$$P^{I}(q) - P^{E}(q) = 0.1, \implies 5 - \frac{2}{3} q - \left(4 + \frac{4}{3} q\right) = 0.1 \implies q = 0.635$$
The price that consumers pay is given by $P^{I}(0.635) = 4.57$ and the amount received by producers is $P^{E}(0.635) = 4.47.$
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: a detailed analysis of the equations, once expressed in prices, reveals that we are just moving things around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: how the burden of the tariff is shared between producers and consumers depends on the elasticity of the supply of exports and the demand for imports.
These, in turn, are determined by the elasticity of supply and demand at foreign and at home, respectively.
As is normal in economics, the agent with a more inelastic curve will support a larger share of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-optimal-tariff&#34;&gt;The optimal tariff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we want to compute the optimal tariff for this economy.
Since we are looking for the optimal $\tau$, we shall introduce it as a parameter in the equations.
For simplicity, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that producers pay the tariff.
As we have seen, in the end this assumtpion is inocuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimal tariff is the value $\tau$ that maximises total welfare in the Home country.
This is made of three pieces: consumers&amp;rsquo; surplus; producers&amp;rsquo; surplus; and government tariff income.
We shall express each as a function of $\tau$, but because they depend on the price, we first need to compute the price payed by consumers and perceived by &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; producers as a function of $\tau.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-international-price&#34;&gt;The international price&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a tariff $\tau$ is in place, the supply of exports is given by:
$$P^{E}(q) = 4 + \frac{4}{3} q + \tau$$
Combining it with the demand for imports $P^{I}(q) = 5 - \frac{2}{3} q$ yields the amount traded as a function of $\tau.$
In particular, $q = \frac{12}{17}(1 - \tau).$
Hence, the price that consumers pay is $P^{I}(q) = 5 - \frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{12}{17}(1-\tau)\right) = \frac{77}{17} + \frac{8}{17}\tau.$
We can verify that, setting $\tau = 0$ yields the equilibrium price under free trade $4.52.$
Similarly, when $\tau = 0.1$, we obtain the previous result: $P^{I} = 4.57.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;consumers-surplus&#34;&gt;Consumers&amp;rsquo; surplus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are using linear equations, the surpluses are triangles.
In the case of the surplus of the consumer, the height of the triangle is given by the difference between the price that correponds to a demand of $q = 0$ and the price they effectively pay.
From the demand equation $P^{H}_{D}(q) = 10 - q$, the price corresponding to the $q = 0$ is $10.$
Hence, the height of the triangle is $10 - \left(\frac{77}{17} + \frac{8}{17}\tau\right).$
The base is just the quantity that corresponds to the equilibrium price (with the tariff).
Therefore, $Q^{H}_{D} = 10 - p = 10 - \left(\frac{77}{17} + \frac{8}{17}\tau\right).$
The surplus of the consumer is the area of the triangle, this is
$$C = \frac{1}{2}\left(10 - \frac{1}{17}(77 - 8\tau)\right)^2$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;producers-surplus&#34;&gt;Producers&amp;rsquo; surplus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proceed similarly for the producers.
In that case, the height of the triangle corresponds to the difference between the price they perceive and the price at which they are willing to sell $q = 0.$
This is, $\frac{77}{17} + \frac{8}{17}\tau + 5.$
The base is the quantity they supply at the relevant price: $Q^{H}_{S} = \frac{5+p}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(5 + \frac{1}{17}(77 + 8\tau)\right).$
The area of the triangle is
$$S = \frac{1}{4}\left(5 + \frac{1}{17}(77 + 8\tau)\right)^2.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;government&#34;&gt;Government&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the government generates tariff duties of value equal to the amount of the imports times the value of the tariff.
This is $\tau\left(Q^{H}_{D}(p) - Q^{H}_{S}(p)\right) = \tau\left(10-\left(\frac{77}{17} + \frac{8}{17}\tau\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(5 + \frac{1}{17}(77 + 8\tau)\right)\right)\right).$
Simplifying:
$$G = \frac{12}{17}(1-\tau)\tau$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;maximize-total-surplus&#34;&gt;Maximize total surplus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we put everything together, total surplus in the economy (as a function of $\tau$) is:
$$W = \frac{3}{578}(7257+72\tau-104\tau^2).$$
Taking the derivative with respect to $\tau$, setting it equal to zero and solving reveals the optimal tariff.
In this case, we find $\tau^\star = \frac{9}{26} = 0.346$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, world supply or world demand will react to any change in a given country.
What matters is the size of the impact, and for a small country, it is negligeable.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works equally well if we assume that Home consumers have to pay the tariff.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Liaison mechanism</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/liaison_mechanism/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/liaison_mechanism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;liaison-mechanism&#34;&gt;Liaison Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This instrument combines a tariff on imports with a production subsidy.
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: different from an export subsidy, here the Home country is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an exporter.
The main idea behind it is to boost local production, and this instrument contributes to this end by two means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the tariff, the price at home increase, increasing local production,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the production subsidy, local production is encouraged even more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, liaison mechanisms are established such that the entire revenue coming from the tariff is used to pay production subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effects-of-a-liaison-mechanism&#34;&gt;Effects of a liaison mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify things, we focus on a small, open economy that imports a good.
The first step consists on adding a tariff on imports, we assume it is an &lt;em&gt;ad-valorem&lt;/em&gt; tariff, though.
For a small country, we already know that this represents a deadweight loss, and that the price payed by the consumers equals $p^w(1+\tau)$.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Liaison_part_1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Part_1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, the tariff levied by the government is equal to $p^w \tau (D_\text{tariff} - S_\text{tariff}).$
Next, these proceedings are used to finance a production subsidy at the rate $s$, which further increases the priced &lt;em&gt;received&lt;/em&gt; by the producers to $(p^w(1+\tau)(1+s).$
At the same time, local production increases, which implies that less imports are required, thus reducing the amount of income the government levies.
Is is possible to mathematically balance the two such that the entire amount coming from the tariff is used to finance the production subsidy.
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;, however, that the introduction of the production subsidy does not change the quantity nor the price faced by the consumers.
Thus, the situation is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since local production increases, imports decrease to $D_\text{tariff} - S_\text{subs}.$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, tariff revenue also decreases to $p^w \tau (D_\text{tariff} - S_\text{subs}).$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total amount payed as subsidy is $p^w(1+\tau)s S_\text{subs}.$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p^w \tau D_\text{tariff} - S_\text{subs} = p^w(1+\tau)s S_\text{subs}.$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we observe that production moved from $S_\text{free}$ to $S_\text{subs}$ and producers earn $p^w(1+\tau)(1+s).$
Demand shrinks, as with all tariffs: $D_\text{free}$ to $D_\text{tariff}.$
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Liaison_part_2.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Part_2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumers loss the blue-shaded area, while producers gain the orange surface.
The effect for the government is neutral: as we said, tariff income (dotted area) is equal to the subsidy (star area).
So, we shall compare the following areas:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Liaison_part_3.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Part_3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Lastly, knowing that the dotted area equals the starred area, the total loss of welfare is:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Liaison_part_4.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Part_4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

If we compare the situation with just a tariff, we can see that the total welfare loss is greater.
This is because the production subsidy incentivizes some local producers to produce, while before their production was covered by more efficient foreign imports.
So, the problem is that the subsidy miss-allocated ressources towards relatively inefficient producers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Export subsidies</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/export_subsidies/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/export_subsidies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;export-subsidy&#34;&gt;Export subsidy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An export subsidy a payment to a firm that exports a good abroad.
As with tariffs, export subsidies can be &lt;em&gt;ad-valorem&lt;/em&gt; or specific, although this distinction is not important in the analysis.
First, we shall note that, differently from before, in this case we shall assume that Home exports a good, this is, the autarky price at Home is &lt;strong&gt;lower&lt;/strong&gt; than the international price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effects-of-an-export-subsidy&#34;&gt;Effects of an export subsidy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a countri subsidizes its exports, the domestic price of the product increases.
This is because now, a local producer can sell it a Home at the world price $p^w$, or ship it abroad and gain the world price plus the subsidy: $p^w + s$.
At the same time, the subsidy encourages more local produces to start producing, world supply for the good increases and the world price goes down (here we just focus on the case where the country is large enough to meaningfuly affect world supply).
Thus, as with the tariff, the change in prices implied by the subsidy is shared between consumers at Home, who pay a higher price, and consumers abroad who enjoy a lower price; firms earn the subsidy and the government has to pay for it.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Export_Subsidy.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Export_Subsidy&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

However, different from before, we can show that the net effect of an export subsidy is &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt;:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Export_Subsidy_Welfare.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Export_Subsidy_Welfare&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the effects of an export subsidy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the price in foreign markets, hurting the terms of trade,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases the domestic price,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents a fiscal cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question arises: if export subsidies hurt the exporting country that implements them, why do they exist?
The answer is &amp;ldquo;political economy&amp;rdquo;.
Typically, export subsidies benefit a relatively small but very well organised group of people, for instance, European farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, usually, to avoid re-imports of the goods just exported, an equivalent import tariff is levied.
Otherwise, an exporter could export the good and touch the subsidy, immediately import it and re-export it again to gain again the subsidy, etc.
Tariffs prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Export taxes</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/export_tax/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/export_tax/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;export-tariff&#34;&gt;Export tariff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An export tax is the reverse tool of an export subsidy.
When a country implements an export tax, producers shipping a product abroad have to pay a certain amount to the government.
As usual, the tax can be &lt;em&gt;ad-valorem&lt;/em&gt; or specific.
If the country that imposes an export tax is large, it will influence the world price of the good.
In particular, the world price would increase, which improves the country&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade.
Therefore, an export tariff can improve Home welfare (provided the country is large enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effects-of-an-export-tax&#34;&gt;Effects of an export tax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an export tax is implemented, exporting goods abroad is less profitable: now exporters must pay the tax.
Consequently, less products are shipped abroad, creating an excess supply.
This non-shipped production is channelled towards local consumption, which increases the local supply and pushes the local price down.
The decrease in the local price benefits the consumers, but hurts producers (less exports and lower internal prices).
This can be illustrated grphically as follows:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Export_Tax_1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Export_Tax_1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

As can be seen, after the introduction of the expor tax, world supply is reduced and a new equilibrium emerges.
Now, foreign consumers pay the full new equilibrium price $P^\star_S$.
Local exporters gain, however, $P^\star_S - \tau = P_S$.
Finally, since in equilibrium an exporter is indifferent between selling goods abroad (and gaining $P_S$) or selling domestically, we obtain that local consumers pay also $P_S.$
Hence, at the new equilibrium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price received by exporters decreases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price payed by local consumers decreases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, exports decrease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price payed by foreign consumers increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government collects taxes.
Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Export_Tax_2.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Export_Tax_2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

The total welfare change is given by comparing the net gains (brought about by government revenue, orange area) to welfare losses experienced by producers (blue area).
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Export_Tax_3.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Export_Tax_3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the case of an import tariff, we can show that, as long as a country can influence world prices, it is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; optimal the implement an export tax.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Non-tariff barriers</title>
      <link>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/non-tariff_barriers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/international_trade/non-tariff_barriers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-tariff-barriers-to-trade&#34;&gt;Non-tariff barriers to trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, all the trade measures we have analyzed implied changes in the prices faced by consumers or producers.
However, governments can also influence trade by means of non-tariff barriers which do not operate on prices.
The most common non-tariff barrier are quotas: a physical limit on the amont of goods that a can imported into a country.
We shall analyze their effects, show that for the simplest case quotas and import tariffs are equivalent, and then show how more complex market structures affect the equivalency.
Since non-tariff barriers tend to be more harmful than tariff barriers, the Uruguay round of the World Trade Organisation recommends the usage of tariff barriers instead of non-tariff barriers.
Last, we shall mention some alternative non-tariff barriers that are reguarly employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;import-quotas&#34;&gt;Import quotas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An import quota limits the physical amount of goods that a country can import.
In general, the government allows some local firms to import limited quantities of the good in question, which then they will resell in the local market.
We focus on the simple case of small economy incapable of influencing world prices.
Assuming that, when faced to international prices, Home imports a good $X$, a quota simply limits the quantity that can be imported.
Therefore, the &lt;strong&gt;residual demand&lt;/strong&gt;, this is, the part of Home&amp;rsquo;s demand not covered by imports will be served by local producers.
Thus, if local demand is $D(p)$ and a quota $Q$ is in place, at world prices $p^w$ demand is $D(p^w)$.
However, only $Q$ can be imported, and the remaining $D(p^w)-Q$ demand is served by local firms.
The relevant equilibrium price $p^\star$ equalises the residual demand with the local supply: firms that obtained the import rights have no interest in selling at a lower price.
Thus, local demand is $D(p^\star)$.
Graphically:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Quota.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Quota&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Figure above does directly represent the total welfare loss (dashed area), where we have already subtracted the benefits that accrue to quota-holders (dotted).
The main difference between a quota and tariff is that, with a tariff, the proceedings revert to the government.
However, with a quota, firms that import goods cash the difference between the world price ($p^w$) and the local price ($p^\star$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that, besides a redistribution from the government to quota-holders, the effects of a quota are identical to those of an import tariff, it is no surprise that both instruments are equivalent.
This is, given a tariff level, we can compute a quota that will have exactly the same effects, and the reverse.
Nevertheless, the analysis changes once we consider dynamics effects and imperfect competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-effects-of-a-quota&#34;&gt;Dynamic effects of a quota&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that, for whatever reason, local demand increases.
In the presence of tariff, very little happens: the world price remains unchanged (small country hypothesis), imports increase because of the rising demand, and the government revenue increases because of higher imports.
If the increase in demand is a parallel shift, welfare losses remain unchanged.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Demand_Shift.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Demand_Shift&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a quota limits the quantity that can imported into the country.
Therefore, when demand increases, the residual demand that is left to be served by local producers increases as well: the quota remained the same.
Thus, the local price increases more than before, which further reduces consumers surplus.
As we can see, the additional increase in producers&amp;rsquo; surplus does not completely compensate the harm done to consumers, and total welfare declines more than it would with a tariff.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Demand_Shift_Quota.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Demand_Shift_Quota&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

As mentioned, with the quota, the local price increases more when the demand shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarizing, when a small country with an import tariff experinces an expanding demand, the welfare losses do not change.
The only thing that changes is that improts increase, together with tariff income.
However, with a quota, the local price increases more.
Hence, in a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic setup&lt;/strong&gt;, tariffs and quota are no longer equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With an increasing demand:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An import tariff implies more imports and a constant price, with an increase in government revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An import quota implies constant imports and an increase in prices, with a increase in quota-holders&amp;rsquo; rents.
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; quantitive restrictions, like a quota, tend to remain constant over time in developing countries.
Consequently, the import limitations becomes more stringent with time, and its pervasive effects more important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;imperfect-competition-and-import-quotas&#34;&gt;Imperfect competition and import quotas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the local market is served by a monopoly, Home is a small open economy that imports a good.
Supose also that the government has introduced an import tariff at level $\tau.$
What is the optimal behaviour of the monopolist?
Since there are no restrictions in the number of goods that can be imported, the monopolist is forced by competition to charge a price equal to $p^w(1+\tau).$
Otherwise, if he charged less, he would sell zero as all consumers would turn to imports.
Also, the monopolist has no interest in selling at a price lower than $p^w(1+\tau).$
So, by opening the country to international trade, the monopoly lost it power, and it is forced to operate as if under perfect competition.
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; in fact, we have Bertrant competition.
Graphically, the situation is the same as for trade with a tariff:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Monopoly_Tariff.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monopoly_Tariff&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that we introduce a quota that is equivalent to the above tariff.
With the quota in place, things are different.
Since only few goods can enter the country, as determined by the quota, the residual demand will be served by the local producers: the monopoly.
So, the monopoly will maximise its profits equating the marginal revenue to the marginal cost (see your notes from microeconomics).
This implies a price that is higher than under perfect competition, and the quantity supplied is lower.
Lastly, the firms that hold quota rights will sell the imports at the same price as the monopoly: selling above will lead to zero demand, while selling below does not maximize profits.
In graphical terms:
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eric-roca.github.io/img/international_trade/Monopoly_Quota.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monopoly_Quota&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-standard-trade-model&#34;&gt;The Standard Trade Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that two goods ($X$ and $Y$) are produced in an economy using two production factors (capital $K$ and labour $L$).
Factors are perfectly mobile across sectors, and the production functions for each sector are:
$X=F(K_x,L_x)=K_x^\frac{1}{2} L_x^\frac{1}{2}$ and $Y=G(K_x, L_Y) = A K_y^\frac{1}{2}L_y^\frac{1}{2},$ with $K=K_x+K_y$ and $L=L_x+L_y$.
Determine the Production Possibilities Frontier for this economy, this is, obtain $Y$ as a function of $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: $$A \sqrt{k-\frac{\sqrt{k} x}{\sqrt{l}}} \sqrt{l-\frac{\sqrt{l} x}{\sqrt{k}}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that we can represent the Production Possibilities Frontier of a country using the following function:
$$Y = 10 - X^2,$$
where $X$ and $Y$ represent the two goods produced in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following international prices for each good: $p_x = 1,p_y=0.25$.
Determine how much $X$ and $Y$ will the economy produce and draw a diagram illustrating the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: $X_s=2, Y_s=6.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, assume that consumers&amp;rsquo; utility is given by $U = \log(X) + \log(Y).$
At the relevant international prices $p_x=1, p_y=0.25,$ determine the local demand for $X$ and $Y$.
Does the country import or export $X$ and $Y$?
Illustrate the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: $X_d=1.75, Y_d=7.$ At prices $p_x=1, p_y=0.25,$ the country exports $X$ and imports $Y$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute the relative supply and the relative demand curves for this economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: $\frac{X_s}{Y_s}=\frac{2p}{40-p^2}, \quad \frac{X_d}{Y_d}=\frac{1}{p},\quad p \equiv \frac{p_x}{p_y}.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the autarky equilibrium can be found either by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximising utility subject to the PPF,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the equilibrium relative price and computing the corresponding demand and supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a second country (denoted by a $\star) exists and that it exhibits the following supply and curves:
$$X_s^\star = 3 - \frac{(12 - 38 p + p^3)}{4+4p}, \quad Y_s^\star = \frac{(12 - 38 p + p^3)}{4+4p}.$$
The demand curves coincide with across countries: $X_d^\star = X^d,\quad Y_d^\star = Y^d.$
If the two countries can trade, determine the equilibrium price.
At this price, does the first country import or export $X$ and $Y$?
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: since demand curves are equal in both countries, the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; relative demand coincides with the relative demand of either country.
It is more or less simple to simplify the relative supply function, you should obtain $\frac{X^w_s}{Y^w_s} = \frac{X_s + X^\star_x}{Y_s + Y^\star_s} = p.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: $p = 1$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that countries A and B have two factors of production, capital and labour and produce goods $X$ and $Y$.
Both countries have exactly the same technology, the production of $X$ is capital-intensive, and country A is capital-abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine whether country A imports or exports good $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Solution**: Country A exports good $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do the following changes affect the terms of trade and what is the impact of welfare for both countries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country A increases its capital stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The relative price of $X$ decreases, worsening A&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and improving B&amp;rsquo;s.
Welfare in A may increase (could decrease too, but is unlikely).
Welfare in B increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour supply increases in A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The relative price of $Y$ decreases, improving A&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and worsening B&amp;rsquo;s.
Welfare increases in A and decreases in B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country B increases its capital stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: the relative price of $X$ falls, improving B&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and worsening A&amp;rsquo;s.
Welfare in B increases and decreases in A (A exports less and earns less for each exported good).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour supply increases in B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: the relative price of $Y$ decreases, which improves A&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and worsens B&amp;rsquo;s.
Welfare increases in A, and it may incrase in B or decrease (less likely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea and Singapore are similar economies in that they both have a comparative advantage with respect to the rest of the world in the production of eco-friendly products.
Korea was the first to start producing such goods, and now Singapore is ramping up its production in this sector.
How would you expect this to affect welfare in Korea?
And in the European Union?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The addition of Singaporean exports represents export-biased growth abroad for Korea.
This reduces its terms of trade, and thus reduces welfare in Korea.
For the European Union, instead, the additional exports from Singapore represent import-biased growth, which improves Europe&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and thus welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to overfishing, Norway cannot catch the same quantity of fish as in other years.
This reduces the potential quantity of fished that Norway can produce and also increase the world&amp;rsquo;s relative price of fish (with respect to all other goods $P_A$).
Draw two diagrams to explain how overfishing may increase or decrease welfare in Norway.
Note: the relative production of fish with respect to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;, is the slope of the line connecting the origin to the production point (when fish is in the vertical axis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: If the production of fish relative to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; decreases, then despite the increase in price Norway loses welfare.
Instead, it is also possible for the relative production of fish relative to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; to increase, which combined with the higher fish price improves welfare in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home demand for good X is:
$$D(p) = 40 - 10p.$$
The supply curve is
$$S(p) = 10 + 10p.$$
Find the autarky equilibrium and the demand for imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Equating supply and demand yields:
$$D(p^A) = S(p^A) \implies p^A = 1.5, q^A = D(p^A) = S(p^A) = 25.$$
To obtain the demand for imports, we subtract supply from demand (always verify that we compare quantities)
$$D^i(p) = D(p) - S(p) = 40 - 10p - (10 + 10p) = 30 - 20p$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following curve represents Foreign&amp;rsquo;s inverse of exports:
$$S^e(p) = 1 + 5p.$$
Find the international equilibrium price and the quantity exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Equating the demand for imports and the supply of exports:
$$D^i(p^w) = S^e(p^w) \implies 30 - 20p^w = 1 + 5p^w \implies p^w = 1.16.$$
Note that the international price is lower than the autarky price.
At this price level, the quantity exchanged equals
$$q^w = D^i(1.16) = S^e(1.16) = 6.8.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Home is a small open economy and imposes a specific tariff of $\tau = 0.1$ on imports, what price will consumers at home pay?
How much will local producers receive? How does the tariff affect the government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Because Home is small, the tariff does not affect international prices.
Note: I am simplifying here because with only two countries, any tariff will have an effect, but let&amp;rsquo;s pretend this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the entire tariff will be passed on to consumers.
After all, international sellers have other markets to which they could sell their products and get paid the international price.
For this reason, international sellers are not willing to sell at Home and receive less than the international price.
Consequently, they ask the international price plus the tariff.
Consumers pay this amount, the tariff goes to the government and international sellers receive the international price.
Hence, the price paid by consumers is
$$p^w + \tau = 1.16 + 0.1.$$
Local producers know this, so they charge exactly the same price: if their price is higher, they sell zero, if the price is lower, they could gain more by charging more.
Hence, local producers receive $1.16 + 0.1$.
At this price level, local demand is:
$$D(p^w + \tau) = 40 - 10 \times (1.16 + 0.1) = 27.4.$$
Local supply is
$$S(p^w + \tau) = 10 + 10 \times (1.16 + 0.1) = 22.6.$$
Therefore, imports are $27.4 - 22.6 = 4.8$
We obtain the same result using the equation for the demand for imports:
$$D^i(p^w+\tau) = 30 - 20(1.16 + 0.1) = 4.8.$$
The government earns $\tau = 0.1$ for each imported unit, thus generating a revenue of
$$\tau D^i(p^w + \tau) = 0.1 \times 4.8 = 0.48.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose now that Home is a large economy.
Repeat the previous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: if Home is a large economy, it influences the world price.
To solve for the new international prices, we suppose that exporters pay the tariff (using any other method yields the same result).
In particular, we know that the supply curve indicates willingness to sell, this is, the minimum amount of money at which a seller is willing to sell $\zeta$ units.
First, it is useful to work with the inverse supply of exports curve, this is,
$$P^e(Q) = \frac{Q - 1}{5}.$$
Because we assumed that exporters pay the tariff, an exporter will increase the price he asks to compensate the tariff.
This is, according to the function, sellers were willing to sell $6$ units at a price of $P^e(6) = \frac{6-1}{5} = 1.$
In order to obtain $1$ monetary unit after the transaction, an exporter will be willing to sell the $6$ units at $1 + 0.1$: the tariff $0.1$ goes to the government, and he keeps $1$ as desired.
Hence, after the introduction of the tariff, supply is now
$$P^e_\tau(Q) = \frac{Q-1}{5} + \underbrace{0.1}&lt;em&gt;{\tau} \implies S^e&lt;/em&gt;\tau(p) = 1 + 5(p-\underbrace{0.1}&lt;em&gt;{\tau}).$$
Solving for the equilibrium level:
$$D^i(p^c) = S^e&lt;/em&gt;\tau(p^c) \implies 30 - 20 p^c = 1 + 5(p^c-0.1) \implies p^c = 1.18.$$
This is the price paid by consumers.
International sellers obtain $1.18 - 0.1 = 1.08$.
This is, the world price falls from $p^w = 1.16$ to $p^c - \tau = 1.08$ and this is the amount exporters will obtain by selling the product in any country.
Local producers sell their production at a price $p^c = 1.18$ for the same reason a before.
Finally, imports are $D^i(p^c) = 30 - 20 \times 1.18 = 6.4$ and the government collects
$$\tau D^i(p^c) = 6.4 \times 0.1 = 0.64.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what conditions can a tariff or a tax on exports increase wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Trade instruments always represent a deadweight loss for small economies.
However, large economies can benefit from the introduction of such instruments.
The reason is that, by being large, they can influence the world price.
For instance, a tariff on imports effectively reduces world demand, which pushes the international price down.
Therefore, part of the burden of the tariff is passed to international sellers, who now obtain a lower price for their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the introduction of the tariff increases the local price of the product: local consumers pay more for the imports, which reduces the demand for imports.
Simultaneously, the greater local price incentivizes local producers to enter the market, which further reduces the need to import from abroad (more local producers sell).
Thus, consumers loss and producers gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and crucially, the government earns the entire value of the tariff on each imported item.
Because part of the price change accrued to international sellers, the distortion the tariff imposes on the local market is not as big as it would be for a small economy.
It is possible that what the government earns compensates the losses introduced in the economy.
We can also relate this discussion to the terms of trade: by manipulating international prices, a tariff can improve the terms of trade, reducing the price of the imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note 1: although local producers benefit from the tariff (they can sell at a higher price) this is bad for the economy because it encourages inefficient producers to serve the market, replacing efficient international sellers.
It would be better if only the most efficient ones produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note 2: there is a limit on how large a tariff can be.
In reality, the increase in wellbeing generated by a tariff has an inverse U-shape.
For a small tariff, the gains are small.
They increase up until a maximum and decrease afterwards.
Moreover, once the tariff becomes too large, the economy is better off not trading at all and entering autarky.
Since it is always possible not to trade, welfare under a tariff has a minimum: the welfare level that would prevail in autarky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note 3: part of the burden generated by a tariff is passed to exporters from foreign countries.
The exact share depends on the elasticity of the demand for imports and the supply of exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export taxes are similar, but operate in the reverse.
In that case, they discourage local producers (who now export abroad) from selling abroad, effectively reducing the world supply and increasing the international price that foreign consumers pay.
In that case, this measure benefits local consumers, who enjoy a lower price at the expenses of local producers making less money.
As before, the government earns the tax on each item shipped abroad.
Because the tax effectively changes international prices, part of the burden is suffered by foreign consumers, who now pay a higher international price (we do not care about them).
As a consequence, the local price does not fall by as much as it would if the country were small.
As before, we can relate that to a change in the terms of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note 4: Technically (and mathematically), all countries benefit from such instruments.
However, gains are in general infinitesimal because a country can only affect international supply or demand by a small amount (as mentioned, the effect depends on elasticities).
Only large economies can influence international supply or demand enough as to benefit from tariffs or export taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, barriers to trade worsen economic wellbeing (except for large countries).
However, many countries implement some protectionism under the argument of infant industry protection.
In other cases, they are put in place because of political economy.
Provide some examples and explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The protection of infant industries argues that, before an industry becomes competitive internationally, it requires some protection to permits its development.
Without the initial protection, producers at Home will never invest in the industry because international imports from mature countries are cheaper and of better quality.
Therefore, if the industry has the potential to become internationally competitive, for instance because of a competitive advantage, then it makes sense to afford it protection from international competition, allowing it to grow.
Once the infant industry has developed, it can compete at the international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, during the 80s, Brazil imposed tariffs on computers to protect this industry.
As expected, tariffs increase the local price, hurting Brazilian consumers.
At the same time, it allowed Brazilian computer manufacturers to earn more, because of the higher price.
Ideally, import tariffs should have stimulated the development of a computer industry in Brazil.
However, the policy was a fiasco: computer technology in Brazil stagnated and consumers had to pay a large premium for copies of low-tech foreign computers.
In contrast, Canada protected its manufacturing industry during 1890 by imposing large tariffs.
This allowed this industry to develop and become competitive with the US.
A similar argument holds for South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, rent-seeking within the frame of political economics tends to be harmful.
This typically involves a small group of local producers that lobby politicians to protect their industry, for instance, sugar production in the USA.
If a tariff on the import of sugar is imposed, this benefits local sugar producers, who can now sell at a higher price.
At the same time, the effect of the tariff on the general population tends to be very small: the increase in the price consumers pay is insignificant.
Thus, it is unlikely for the general population to protest against such a measure.
Yet, the effect it has on sugar producers is large and, because they benefit from the protectionist measure, they campaign in favor of such tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at the aggregate level, we know that tariff protectionism tends to be harmful.
In that sense, once we consider the additional price that each consumer pays, the total effect is larger than what sugar producers gain (this is what we do when we compute the change in consumers&amp;rsquo; and producers&amp;rsquo; surplus).
Yet, because producers are few and very well organized, they can convince politicians to keep tariffs in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Trade Organization recommends against the use of import quotas and suggests these to be replaced by tariffs.
Explain why quotas may have worse effects than an equivalent tariff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: in general, tariffs and quotas are equivalent, this is, for a given tariff it is possible to compute the equivalent quota and vice-versa.
However, this is only true under ideal conditions.
Two cases provide a rationale in favor of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: A growing economy.
When an economy grows, its demand increases.
After a quota is in place, local producers serve the residual demand, this is, the part of the demand that is not covered with imports.
For instance, if local demand is $Q(p) = 10 - p$ and a quota $\phi$ is in place, the residual demand is $Q^r(p, \phi) = 10 - p - \phi$.
This residual demand determines the equilibrium price.
Hence, when a country grows, demand increases and so does the residual demand.
If we assume that neither local supply nor the quota changes, the increase in residual demand is not matched by an increase in supply and the equilibrium price rises.
This reduces consumers surplus.
At the same time, because of the increase in price (and in demand), some local producers that before could not participate in the market now find this profitable.
So, we are replacing efficient foreign producers for inefficient local producers: remember that they could not compete against the foreign suppliers.
Instead, with a tariff, the increase in demand would translate as an increase in imports, with no further effects on prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the negative effect of the quota can be offset if we allow the quota to adapt to the demand increase.
Alternatively, if local supply is also growing, the negative impact is also mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Imperfect competition at home.
If the local market at home is served by a monopoly, it will maximize profits by equating marginal income to marginal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we note that when the monopoly faces international competition, it loses its monopoly power.
In fact, when foreign producers can sell at Home, the monopoly is no longer a monopoly.
To see this, suppose that world price is $p^w$, and for the moment, let&amp;rsquo;s assume free trade.
Local consumers can: a) buy from the monopoly, or b) import the good at price $p^w$.
If the monopoly charges more than $p^w$, it sells zero and makes zero profits.
The reason is simple: consumers will prefer to import the good from abroad.
At the same time, if the monopoly sold at a price lower than $p^w$, it could gain more by increasing its price until $p^w$.
In that sense, international competition is competition for the monopoly, and it must adjust its behavior.
This implies that it no longer holds any power: deviating from the international price means no profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that a tariff is in place and that Home is a small, open economy.
Essentially, nothing changes with respect to the free trade situation.
We know that the price at home will increase to $p^w + \tau$, and thus the monopoly will be forced to sell at the price $p^w + \tau$.
As before, deviating from it implies lower profits.
In reality, the monopoly prefers the situation with the tariff, because the price increases.
However, it still bears no monopoly power whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when a quota is in place, the residual demand can only be satisfied with local production.
In this case, the monopoly retains its power on this part of the demand.
To see why, imagine the situation of a consumer: if his demand is not covered from imports, he must buy from the monopoly.
Hence, the monopoly will maximize its profits on this part of the demand.
In a sense, the introduction of the quota creates a captive demand: either it buys from the monopoly, or it does not buy at all.
Thus, in fact, the monopoly is can behave as a monopoly for the residual demand.
Notice how, under free trade or tariffs, the monopoly operated, instead, under perfect competition.
Finally, we shall mention that quotas are typically attributed to some local firms that can import from abroad.
These firms will buy cheaply from abroad and sell at the same price as the monopoly, cashing the price difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Home is a large economy that &lt;strong&gt;exports&lt;/strong&gt; a good.
Local demand and supply are given by:
$$D_h(p) = 10 - p$$
and
$$S_h(p) = 30 + 2p.$$
Compute Home&amp;rsquo;s supply of exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that world demand for imports is
$$D^i(p) = 25 - p,$$
compute the equilibrium price and the quantity traded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: the supply of exports is given by
$$S^e_h(p) = S_h(p) - D_h(p) = 30 + 2p - (10 - p) = 20 + 3p.$$
Equating it to the demand for imports yields the equilibrium world price.
$$S^e_h(p^w) = D^i(p^w) \implies 20 + 3 p^w = 25 - p^w \implies p^w = 1.25.$$
At this price level, exports are equal to
$$S^e_h(p^w) = 20 + 3 \times 1.25 = 23.75.$$
We can also compute exports by comparing local supply and demand:
$$S_h(p^w) = 30 + 2 \times 1.25 = 32.5, \quad D_h(p^w) = 10 - 1.25 = 8.75$$
and exports are $32.5 - 8.75 = 23.75$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the government introduces an export subsidy of $s = 0.1$, how does it affect the prices received by Home exporters and the price paid by Home consumers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the country is large, the introduction of a subsidy affects world supply.
With the subsidy, exporters from Home are willing to accept a lower international price: the difference will be covered by the subsidy.
This is, before the introduction of the subsidy, they were willing to sell at the price indicated by the inverse supply of exports function:
$$P^e(Q) = \frac{Q - 20}{3}.$$
For instance,  Home producers will sell $Q = 50$ units at a price of $10$.
With the subsidy of $s = 0.1$ in place, this producer is ready to accept $10 - 0.1 = 9.9$ from a foreign customer because the government offers $0.1$ for each exported unit.
Thus, with the subsidy, the price at which Home exporters are willing to sell is:
$$P_s = \frac{Q-20}{3} - \underbrace{0.1}&lt;em&gt;{s} \implies S^e_s = 20 + 3 (p+\underbrace{0.1}&lt;/em&gt;{s}).$$
Hence, the equilibrium price solves
$$S^e_w(p^f) = D^i(p^f) \implies 20 + 3(p^f+0.1) = 25 - p^f \implies p^f =1.175.$$
This is the price level that foreign consumers pay.
However, Home exporters obtain $1.175 + 0.1 = 1.275.$
Because exporters should be indifferent between selling at home or exporting (gaining $1.275$), consumers at Home pay $p^c = 1.175 + 0.1 = 1.275.$
Thus, demand at Home is $D_h(p^c) = 8.725$, production at home is $S_h(p^c) = 32.55$ and exports are $23.825$.
The government thus pays $s S^e(p^c) = 23.825 \times 0.1 = 2.3825$ as subsidies.
Overall, there is a reduction in surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Home is a small, open economy.
Supply and demand for a good are
$$D(p) = 20 - p$$
and
$$S(p) = 1 + p.$$
Furthermore, assume that the international price $p^w$ for this good is $3$.
The government has in place a specific tariff of value equal to $\tau = 0.5$.
Compute the equivalent quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: With the tariff in place, the price faced by Home consumers is $p^w + \tau = 3.5$ because the country is small.
At this price level, demand is $D(3.5) 20 - 3.5 = 16.5$.
Home producers also earn $3.5$, and they supply $S(3.5) = 1 + 3.5 = 4.5$ units.
Thus, imports are $D(3.5) - S(3.5) = 16.5 - 4.5 = 12$.
Consequently, a quota $\phi = 12$ will have the same effects as the tariff.
Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze it.
With the quota, the residual demand is $D^r(p, \phi) = 20 - p - \phi$.
Because $\phi 12 \implies D^r(p, 12) = 20 - p - 12 = 8 - p$.
This residual demand will be satisfied by local producers.
The equilibrium price solves:
$$D^r(p^\phi, 12) = S(p^\phi) \implies 8 - p^\phi = 1 + p^\phi \implies  p^\phi = 3.5.$$
As we can see, the price level coincides with the one prevailing under the tariff.
Hence, all distortions are the same (you can compute them or check graphically).
Notice that holders of quota rights import the good at the international price $p^w = 3$ and sell it at the local price $p^\phi = 3.5$, gaining $0.5$ per unit.
Because the quota is $12$ units, they import this amount and thus make $12 \times 0.5 = 6$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose now that the local producer at home is a monopoly.
Compute the equilibrium price at home after the quota $\phi=12$ is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The monopoly maximizes its profits by equating marginal revenue to marginal cost (the supply curve).
Marginal revenue can be computed as the derivative of revenue with respect to quantity.
$$\mathrm{Rev} = q P(q) = q (8 - q) = 8q - q^2$$
$$\mathrm{MR} = \frac{\partial \mathrm{Rev}}{\partial q} = 20 - 2q$$
Hence, the quantity the monopoly sells solves:
$$8 - 2q^M = q^N - 1 \implies q^M = 3$$
The corresponding price is $p^M = 8 - 3 = 5$.
Clearly, this price is higher than the one prevailing under the tariff.
Moreover, quota holders obtain higher profits because they still import goods at price $3$ and sell at the price of $5$.
We can also check that, at a price $5$ demand is $20 - 5 = 15$.
This is covered by the imports the quota allows (12) and locally produced goods (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should the quota change to have the same equilibrium price under the monopoly as under the tariff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: For a given quota level $\theta$, the residual demand satisfied by the monopoly is
$$Q^r(p,\theta) = 20 - p - \theta \implies P(Q,\theta) = 20 - Q - \theta.$$
Hence, we can compute a generic version of the marginal revenue for any value $\theta.$
$$\mathrm{MR}(\theta) = \frac{\partial (20 - Q - \theta)Q}{\partial Q} = 20 - 2Q -\theta.$$
Therefore, the monopoly solves:
$$20-2Q-\theta = Q - 1 \implies Q^M(\theta) = \frac{21-\theta}{3}.$$
The price level associated to this quantity is given by the inverse residual demand: $P^r(q,\theta) = 20 -\theta - q.$
In particular, the quantity $\frac{21-\theta}{3}$ will be priced at
$$P^r\left(\frac{21-\theta}{3}, \theta\right) = 20 - \theta - \frac{21-\theta}{3} = 13 - \frac{2}{3}\theta.$$
Since we want the price to be equal to $3.5$, we thus have
$$3.5 = 13 - \frac{2}{3}\theta \implies \theta = 14.25.$$
So, a quota of $14.25$ will have the same effects as the tariff.
Note how we need a larger quota to induce the monopoly to decrease its price level.
Effectively, a larger quota reduces the residual demand, and as usual, a demand reduction implies a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercises relative to the Standard Trade Model.
Discuss how the following events could affect the terms of trade and the wellbeing.
a) Egypt exports cotton.
A severe drought in Benin, another country that exports cotton, reduces its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: The event reduces the world supply of cotton, thus its relative price with respect to any other good will increase.
Because Egypt exports cotton, the rise in its relative price improves its terms of trade, and it will be positive for its economy.
For Benin, the conclusions are not as straightforward.
The economy certainly benefits from the increase in the relative price.
However, it also produces and sells less cotton, so the total effects are ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) The USA exported oil.
Recent technological improvements make exploiting shale oil feasible, increasing its supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: For the US economy, this represents export-biased technological growth at Home (the US).
The exploitation of shale oil increases its supply and the relative price of oil falls.
Depending on the magnitudes, the event may be positive or negative for the economy.
On the one side, the US economy will be able to export more oil.
On the other, they will do so at a lower price.
The net effect is likely to be positive, but we cannot be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other countries exporting oil, the US exporting shale oil is equivalent to export-biased growth at Home.
After all, it is as if, let&amp;rsquo;s say, Saudi Arabia was producing more oil.
However, different from above, the implications are negative for the remaining oil producing countries: the price of the good they sell falls, but they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; producing more.
Hence, this will reduce their terms of trade and negatively impact their economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for oil importers, the exploitation of shale oil in the US represents that the rest of the world is export-biased growing: they are growing in the sector they export.
This has positive consequences on the economy because the relative price of the good we import decreases, improving our terms of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) France imports rubber to produce tires.
The German company Bayer discovers synthetic rubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents export-biased growth in the rest of the world: foreign countries are growing in a sector they export.
This will decrease the relative price of rubber, improving French terms of trade and raising wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the effect is also positive for Germany.
Before synthetic rubber, the German economy did not produce nor sell any rubber.
Hence, now it is able to export a previously non-exported product.
This is perhaps surprising, because in general we would think that Germany experienced export-biased at home, but in fact it did not export anything before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Great Britain exported textiles.
The invention of the steam engine in the UK makes textile production much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: For the UK, Home is growing export-biased: it is possible to produce more of the goods it sells.
This entails a decrease in the relative price of textiles, which reduces the UK&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade.
The total effect may be positive or negative, depending on whether the higher production or the lower price dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) Italy imports cars from abroad.
Ferrari decides to produce affordable cars in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Home (Italy) is import-based growing because it produces more of the goods it imported.
This will have positive effects on its economy: the world relative demand of cars decreases, reducing its relative price and improving Italy&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade.
The effect on the Italian economy will be positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
